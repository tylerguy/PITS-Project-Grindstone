# PITS-Project-Grindstone

I'm done with the PITS, also known as the Peach Investigation and Tactics Squad, so I've decided to make all this information public, should it deem useful in UMAD's Investigations.

All our exchanges with Peach, who is indeed a traitor to UMAD, have been included in /transcripts (https://github.com/tylerguy/PITS-Project-Grindstone/tree/main/transcripts).

All our investigations on UMAD have been reported in /info (https://github.com/tylerguy/PITS-Project-Grindstone/tree/main/info).

I want to see Peach (who we believed to be under an alliance) punished for exposing the acts of UMAD, in exchange for my cooperation I hope I can gain good standing within the ranks of UMAD
