<h1>Planar Discussion</h1>

<p>1) Unprogrammed Aether is immaterial and volatile, rapidly expanding outwards, being submerged in it results in, presumably painful, death by corrosion or some other process with similar results. It is unknown. Only objects are allowed to be submerged in Aether by law.</p>
<p>2) Time dilates non-linearly as one gets closer to the 8th ring.</p>
<p>Suggests that the 8th ring is a point where infinite time would be infinitesimal in time anywhere else.</p>
<p>Central point is outside of time, a moment here correlates to countless infinities there. Maybe define it better with hyperreal numbers, or, physicist’s calculus.</p>
<p>3) Because of this event-horizon-like nature one might conclude that rings 9 - 15 are causally inaccessible, and therefore could not be detected at all.</p>
<p>However, Department Head Zuchterin said that we detect the existence of rings 9 - 15 through wave patterns in the Aetherial matrix.</p>
<p>Does this further suggest that the usage of the word infinity was false, as an Aetherial matrix disturbance would need infinite time to cross the 8th ring, since the derivative of time in, the 1st or 15th ring for instance, with respect to the time in the 8th ring is zero? Department Head Zuchterin did not clarify this.</p>
<p>4) Time dilations can help determine the wave patterns in the Aetherial matrix, consider waves in the Aetherial matrix with period and frequency, time dilations modify these properties, allowing us to study time dilation.</p>
<p>How is this done? Possible conclusions that I have come up with seem rather vague, such as assuming constant wave patterns in the Aetherial matrix in the entire universe, like averaging them over the large scale structure, similar to what cosmology does.</p>
<p>Note the similarities to gravitational time dilation measurements.</p>
<p>5) Hourglass Model vs. Disk Model:</p>
<p>Hourglass: Better defines time dilation, hourglass on its side. Simplifies the dimensions, so it is easier to visualize, and allows a visualization of time. Perhaps the 6D space the 5D hourglass surface is embedded in?</p>
<p>Disk Model: Is more true to the 5D structure of the universe, better at spatial understanding.</p>
<p>6) It is confirmed that the Planar Department believes that in 5D space, boundless volumes, perhaps of lower dimension or not, are projected to finite 5D volumes.</p>
<p>In fact, one could say that all planes occupy a finite 5D volume, regardless of whether or not it is bounded.</p>
<p>7) Any overlap in the 5D coordinates of points in two different planes is called an overlap. Does this suggest that two objects could be at the same place at the same time? Or are they at the same point in 5D space, but not in 6D spacetime?</p>
<p>8) All planes occupy 5D finite volumes, but creatures in these planes may be closed off to none, one, or more dimensions of this 5D plane.</p>
<p>Can we even consider the extra dimensions to even be part of the structure of our plane? How do they affect us? Related to the possibility of finite representation of these planes being simply mathematical conveniences?</p>
<p>Note that if these planes did not actually occupy finite 5D space, they’d probably know this from measurements of Aether wave patterns.</p>
<p>“What we know about the wave patterns in the aetherial matrix suggest that there is a finite 5 dimensional space however. An edge and a center if you would. This however is only theoretical.”
We can only hypothesize that there is an edge to the universe, that the universe is a finite 5D space.</p>
<p>9) One can use the aetherial matrix to target specific planes one wishes to research for Belthidian Laws through massive summation of the aether between two planes. This summation forces an overlay? Limitations and dangers.</p>
<p>10) Natural laws can differ simply by two planes being in the same proximity, not necessarily on top of each other.</p>
<p>Does this suggest the role of Aether wave patterns and their amplitudes in determining natural laws? The reason magic works?</p>
<p>11) Our Planar Designation is EXT-918, UMAD is M-1.1.</p>
<p>12) It is believed that M-1.1's unique location in the universe has allowed that plane to discover the Aetherial matrix, Aether, and other magics.</p>
<p>The history of these discoveries is a cultural question.</p>
<p>13) We are not allowed (yet) to find out how they formulated the time dilation factor for different locations in the universe.</p>
<p>Could probably try my hand at it if I knew more of their axiomatic principles in the study of large-scale structures of the universe.</p>
<p>14) In Genevieve’s time, she has found evidence to suggest that the creation of planes is related to behavior of the Aetherial matrix.</p>
<p>15) Quality of charge: Charge can be considered a qualitative characteristic for elementary observation (electric charge determines direction of motion in an electric field for example). Charge characteristics could be linear in a positive direction, quantitatively linear for all integers, or even be multidimensional in mathematical expressions.</p>
<p>Like vector spaces over a field of some sort? Seems like the additive inverses might not be held axioms here though.</p>
<p>Our concept of mass has one quality of charge, positive. If mass was negative, we’d have two. What about massless objects? No additional quality since massless objects are not affected by experiments for mass?</p>
<p>16) The immaterial has three qualities of charge.</p>
<p>Think of the top half of a 2D plane, top half of a complex number plane?</p>
<p>17) Department Head Zuchterin mentioned nonlinear mathematics, not quite like nonlinear equations and curved space. Did not have time to elaborate.</p>
<p>18) There exist three certain planes of existence, Material, Shadow, and Etherial. They constantly form overlays over each other, and all exist within ring 1.</p>
<p>19) The school of translocation uses two overlays that are created and abruptly end. The object does not travel, just displaced. For planes X and Y, it works like: X → Y → X</p>
<p>X and Y could be either the Shadow, Etherial, and Material. Overlays terminate simultaneously, and planar travel does not occur.</p>
<p>Requires elaboration on how overlay works, do two places exist at the same place or no?</p>
