<p>UMAD-MANAGEMENT:</p>
<p>Aeonization (not to be confused with the process of aeonization), Dismissal, Healing, Illusion, Programming (not to be confused with the process of programming), Summoning, Synthesis, Thermokinetics, and Translocation are the Aetherial schools as defined by UMAD.</p>
<p>Aeonization as a school of magic that is utilized to undo links within programming and safely disperse aether.&nbsp; Aeonization specialists can quickly remove programming and inhibit the use of spells while also creating new aeonized objects for use in spellcasting.&nbsp; This school is also effective and maintaining Aetherial residue in select space to disguise auras, make auras visible, or create Aetherial impressions that can later be made visible by aeonization specialists.</p>
<p>Dismissal is the school of magic that specializes in the movement of material to its naturalized plane over a distance.&nbsp; This effect does not require specificity but is more effective the closer the subject is to the naturalized plane.&nbsp; This school can also work in the inverse locking an entity or object to a non naturalized plane.</p>
<p>Healing is a poorly understood school of magic with limited current applications but a plethora of applications in theory.&nbsp; Healing utilizes biological systems own machinery and resources to rapidly move, act, or stimulate for a desired result.&nbsp; This could mean the rapid clotting of blood, the induction of particular emotions, the removal of sensation, the creation of new sensation, and many other applications.</p>
<p>Illusion is the manipulation of transverse and longitudinal waves of material to create visual or auditory sensations and do not directly effect biological systems.&nbsp; This manipulation of light and sound is not limited to visible or auditory spectrums of different species.</p>
<p>Programming is the creation of Aetherial frames to overlap material for manipulation of the material or creation of a constant summation and programming at a designated location.&nbsp; This means enchantment, constructs, and undead.</p>
<p>Summoning is the displacement of material from one plane to another by means netting.&nbsp; Further specification of the material or naturalized plane yields greater complexity to casting and often requires greater rate and quantity of aether.&nbsp; Summoning from more distant planes also requires a greater expense of aether.</p>
<p>Synthesis is the youngest study and relies heavily on advanced understanding of Belthidian Laws.&nbsp; Most casters follow general rules for casting synthesis but absolutes have been determined through experimentation.&nbsp; This is the manipulation of material to take on a different function.&nbsp; Synthesis makes one material from another. Crystalline structures have been theorized as possible but experimentally have rarely been synthesized.</p>
<p>Thermokinetics is the father school to synthesis.&nbsp; This school has often been utilized in warfare but also in civil projects.&nbsp; It is the manipulation of material, the readiness to transfer thermal energy, and the movement of thermal energy.&nbsp; Heat may be displaced allowing for a place of cold near the hot spot or material moved rapidly to create a vacuum.&nbsp; The creation of a vacuum is much easier however in translocation.</p>
<p>Translocation is the displacement but not movement of material from one point in space to another within the same plane.&nbsp; While summoning could function this way in theory it is much more practical to translocation objects on the same plane.&nbsp; With that said translocation is often determined impractical due to the difficulty of specializing in it.&nbsp; Long distances of displacement and large object being displaced increase error and risk.&nbsp; Translocation into other material could end in serious consequences.&nbsp; For this reason transportation and delivery of objects through translocation is not done.&nbsp; Instead translocation often has practical applications in wartime, defense, and manufacturing.</p>
