<p>List of gods (that we know of):</p>
<p>Quoseem: god of communication, death, efficiency (name borrowed for any system of aetherial programming meant for communication)</p>
<p>Caboumin: god of love and hate</p>
<p>Doublelock: god of fate, absolute concepts, intellectual immortality</p>
<p>“They are the god fate, absolute concepts, and intellectual immortality.&nbsp; In the beginning they left time to be seated in the center of all things.&nbsp; There is no interaction with them at all, they just are.&nbsp; They wait outside of time for the end to occur where he also is.&nbsp; No one is certain of how to clearly find their perpetuity after judgement so those who worship them simply attempt to find intellectual immortality and be remembered forever.&nbsp; The consequence of this is always great but not always beneficial to others.”</p>
<p>Doublelock does not care is an old saying.&nbsp; It means that fate is blind and what will happen will.&nbsp; It's an admission that your life isn't necessarily in your hands and bad things happen to good people but that's life.</p>
<p>Moon Patron?</p>
<p>The Scoundrel?: bestowed part of themself to all that would be sentient giving us free will</p>
<p>Belthid, god of physics?</p>
<p>[will add more after i’ve sifted through the entire document -nobody]</p>
