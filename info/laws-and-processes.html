<p>Necromancy: Necromancy is more appropriately titled a programming department.&nbsp; They work on aetherial structures, constructs we call them.&nbsp; Constructs have aetherial shape that overlays on the material object.&nbsp; It's much easier to craft a construct from a corpse however than hunks of metal.&nbsp; They specialize in the multidimensional code and networks that create the structure of these objects.&nbsp; Their department head does not communicate directly often but is very informative if you reach out to them.&nbsp; They seem to just be shut in their office all day.</p>
<p>Culture: Culture is a strange department.&nbsp; They study everything from Richwood theory to history to social enigmas.&nbsp; They hope to better understand the foundations of culture and what makes a person themselves.&nbsp; Many of them are taught deceptive tactics so that they can produce "cleaner" data from their experiments.&nbsp; When the project is declared necessary for national security they usually do not even tell their subjects of their role.&nbsp; This makes them suspicious to me in just about everything they do.</p>
<p>Engineering: Engineering and Alchemy were once the same department and the Religious studies department was consumed by culture for the sake of secularity in study.&nbsp; Engineering lacks a department head and no one seems like they are in a rush to fill the position.&nbsp; Engineering operates on much of what you suspect and they are often involved in government projects especially military projects.&nbsp; They have a strange man there named Meer Soot who is very temperamental.&nbsp; It's believed his actions have led to the death of his last two assistants yet he still operates with a wealth of funding for his projects.&nbsp; Projects of nonsense that fit closer into aetherial research than anything.</p>
<p>Alchemy: Alchemy has a very informative and prompt head.&nbsp; He is a stickler for deadlines however and plays favorites often with his research funding practices.&nbsp; Not much to really say about them other than hold your breath when you can on that floor and if it looks volatile then it probably is.&nbsp; If it doesn't then it still probably is.</p>
<p>Aetherial Study: They study aetherial effects from all stages.&nbsp; They make the magic happen, pun intended.&nbsp; They research Summation, Aeonization, and magical programming.&nbsp; If you want to learn aetherial theory they are the guys.&nbsp; Though many times you leave work glowing just a little bit.</p>
<p>Planar: [peach does not give a very exhaustive or useful definition of what planar does from what i can tell So Far, they seem to be field researchers for other planes of existence mostly?] As I said before the Planar department does not keep their department head for long.&nbsp; They deal with some of the most dangerous field work as every plane you cross to provides a chance at being plane touched.</p>
<p>[note: ‘plane touched’ is, to simplify it, you (as an entity) attunAeonization as a school of magic that is utilized to undo links within programming and safely disperse aether.&nbsp; Aeonization specialists can quickly remove programming and inhibit the use of spells while also creating new aeonized objects for use in spellcasting.&nbsp; This school is also effective and maintaining Aetherial residue in select space to disguise auras, make auras visible, or create Aetherial impressions that can later be made visible by aeonization specialists.</p>
<p><mark class="marker-green">ing to the conditions of a plane you’re passing through, which can lead to things such as permanently losing your perception of time or your very sentience] &lt;&lt; this needs to be amended</mark></p>
