<p><strong>Peach — Today at 17:54</strong></p>
<p>I'm adding Brandon and Snow to our char.&nbsp; That makes 5 now.</p>
<p>Also, how is everyone today?&nbsp; I hope safe.&nbsp; It's been a few day.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 17:56</strong></p>
<p>We're doing good. Glad to see they worked out. We'll get them caught up on what we've learned so far, so they can be ready to jump right in</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:04</strong></p>
<p>Did some more digging at the Whimsy in town.&nbsp; Tuns out "SC" only comes around right before the Blue Banner performs there.&nbsp; Also Necromancy is functioning at a higher security level now.&nbsp; When I checked in today at the front desk I also noticed Janet had smudges of orange ink on her thumb and first finger.&nbsp; The only other time I saw orange ink used here was on that document I previously mentioned.&nbsp; I'm sure I could find something in her outbox but she is always at her desk, ALWAYS.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 18:13</strong></p>
<p>It's good to hear back from you Peach. I'm doing alright, glad to hear the others have gotten in</p>
<p>We were discussing the mysterious "SC" earlier actually. What's the Blue Banner? And any particular gossip about the Necromancy department that would give them a higher security level?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:17</strong></p>
<p>Oh?&nbsp; What were you discussing about SC?&nbsp; Blue Banner Theatre is a group that performs mostly at the Wizard's Whimsy a local eatery that never seems to have food.&nbsp; At least they do but the chef seems mad and you might be waiting ages for anything.&nbsp; They generate most of their revenue by other business prospects.&nbsp; The Theatre group is run by Eruc who must be the most talentedly terrible playwright I have ever seen.&nbsp; Never have I known more offensive, distracting, and disgusting performances than very well all of his.&nbsp; I'd assume that Necromancy is under high alert because of what I did last week.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 18:28</strong></p>
<p>We were trying to look for anyone in the server with "SC" as initials. I did a bit of a trawl through the twitters of researchers Hyles and March but couldn't find anything, which leads me to believe that SC might just be entirely on your end. I'm guessing either the Blue Banner is some kind of shock value show or a money laundering scheme going off on that. Anything related to the researchers on our end that might've been going on at the Wizard's Whimsy? You did mention that in relation to us saying that the researchers on our end are entertainers</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 18:46</strong></p>
<p>Thank you everyone for having me. It seems really dangerous to try to get to the documents while it's still at Janet's desk. Unless you have some way of having the Assistant Director get Janet away for a minute so you can get a sneak peak.</p>
<p>Since that seems to be only person she listens to.</p>
<p>Also, The Wizard's Whimsy sounds like a terrible place that's perfect for scoundrels of all kinds to linger around.</p>
<p>Oh, and I don't know if the others mentioned, but I do volunteer myself to go into the Necromancy department.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 19:07</strong></p>
<p>The Whimzy is the closest place to grab food, albiet sometimes, and have a show, albiet terible, to UMAD.&nbsp; A goblin lives there, the only legal goblin I know of.&nbsp; Culture claims he is a social experiment back during the founding of the academy and exists as UMAD property giving him safety to continue his existance within the city.&nbsp; Clever creature he attempts to claim any property ownership by using a surrigate.&nbsp; I'm not certain how a goblin ammassed any money however really let alone has been keeping failing businesses alive.&nbsp; Anyone in town you suggest he is cleaning money to might readily agree but it's uncertain if that would be out of general hate for him.</p>
<p>The church of the scoundrel might be a fair recruitment office for that theatre.&nbsp; The common patron are just those traveling who don't know better though or those people who think they might luck into getting a meal that day.&nbsp; Do you mean the Assistant Headmaster?&nbsp; I'd say anyone listens to him really.&nbsp; So Necromancy and Aetherial Studies are of interest to you all so far?</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 19:10</strong></p>
<p>Well no one's there for the food or entertainment, so the money has to be coming from somewhere. Is the goblins name Culture? He has to be clever if he's the only legal goblin. Judging by the shady dealings, he may have some dirt on someone and is using it to gain citizenship and such.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 19:11</strong></p>
<p>By Culture I mean the Culture department.&nbsp; I'm not sure his name but it shouldn't be hard to find.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 19:12</strong></p>
<p>Who knows, maybe when you figure out his name it'll tie up a couple ends.</p>
<p>Have you only witness SC's in and outs from the Whimsy or have you actually gone inside?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 19:13</strong></p>
<p>I have no idea how a goblin could gain citizenship here.&nbsp; I could ask for legal advice however if there might be a means to do so?&nbsp; My representator is in town but it's a long treck.&nbsp; I don't think I'd get much else done in a day if I sought him out.</p>
<p><mark class="pen-red"><strong>[Peach’s messages appear in Base 64]</strong></mark></p>
<p>I have never seen SC, at least not that I know of.</p>
<p>Is this better by the way?</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 19:15</strong></p>
<p>This is much better, it actually helps eliminate a step</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 19:15</strong></p>
<p>Can anyone understand me better or should I switch back to my other connection?</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 19:16</strong></p>
<p>This way is much better</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 19:16</strong></p>
<p>Step?&nbsp; Regardless that's good.&nbsp; I'll see how long I can maintain this.&nbsp; It's not a very strong connection but if it works better I'll use this.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 19:17</strong></p>
<p>If it'll extend transmissions then you can go back to the previous one, it's not hard to translate in my opinion.</p>
<p>It's a two step process to decode usually, the new way made it one.</p>
<p>I have a couple questions though, if you don't mind.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 19:20</strong></p>
<p>It was a bit of a change but it does make it easier in the end, thank you</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 19:24</strong></p>
<p>The connection is just weaker.&nbsp; Might have a few more interruptions is all.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 19:29</strong></p>
<p>I have a couple questions relating to things I've seen in the past. The first cypher's answer was "Doublelock does not care." Would you happen to know what that would be in relation to? And also, if Bruno from Recruiting was a person of interest in all of this.</p>
<p>And who is all of the official heads of the research departments? Besides Pauchik, Planar, and Engineering.</p>
<p>Those are my only questions thus far</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 19:37</strong></p>
<p>Doublelock does not care is an old saying.&nbsp; It means that fate is blind and what will happen will.&nbsp; It's an admission that your life isn't necessarily in your hands and bad things happen to good people but that's life.</p>
<p>Engineering doesn't have a head.&nbsp; I can find out who the Planar department head is currently but I usually ignore it because it changes so often.&nbsp; Pauchik is just a researcher he is not a head.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 19:39</strong></p>
<p>Oh I thought he was.</p>
<p>Is knowing who the heads of the departments matter or will we know over time?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 19:40</strong></p>
<p>Genevieve Zuchterin is the current head of planar.&nbsp; Nope, Pauchik is just a researcher who occassional does maintenance.</p>
<p>Necromancy is run by Emel Getrank.</p>
<p>I suppose knowing their names might help with communication?&nbsp; The department head names are very available to me and everyone else here.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Caught another message. Hold on.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 19:45</strong></p>
<p>I'm keeping personal writtn notes so I can keep better track of what's going on, so I'm trying to fill in blanks.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 19:46</strong></p>
<p>This one isn't coded so it must not be to a department head.&nbsp; Looks like Researcher Hyles is meeting with Culture again today.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 19:47</strong></p>
<p>Oh my, I wonder what about.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 19:52</strong></p>
<p>Hmm... Curious. I wonder what he's up to?</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 19:53</strong></p>
<p>Who knows. For now I wouldn't worry too much about it</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 19:54</strong></p>
<p>Well, when it comes to Researcher Hyles, I need to know, cause I might be meeting with him for his entertainment work in the future. I need to know what to avoid discussing, so as not to blow our cover</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 19:55</strong></p>
<p>Fair enough I suppose xD</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 20:20</strong></p>
<p>Hey just so we can iron out the details on the researchers on our ends, do you happen to know which departments Hyles, March, Freeman, and Marino work in and their relative standing in the hierarchy of the departments?</p>
<p><mark class="pen-red"><strong>[Peach’s messages appear in reverse Base 64]</strong></mark></p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 21:07</strong></p>
<p>I had a small amount of aetherial backlash but I'm back.&nbsp; I re-established the connection but it looks like I'm not going to attempt what I did last time.&nbsp; I'm sorry if this is more difficult to understand.&nbsp; If I had access to more equipment maybe this would be easier.</p>
<p>Good question Chuck.&nbsp; I unfortunately have limitations on finding out because everyone of their personelle files have been moved to a place beyond my clearance.&nbsp; I have done some digging on this however already.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 21:11</strong></p>
<p>It's no problem Peach, it's only a small extra step that we have to deal with in interpreting it, it's no bother and if it's easier for you then that's what we have to work with.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 21:15</strong></p>
<p>Henceforth I will be referring to the researcher who writes in orange as Researcher Orange.&nbsp; Hyles seems to have worked quite often with Culture but I have not confirmed his department or status.&nbsp; I do know he must at least be of researcher standing if not a field agent.&nbsp; Orange I can confirm is a field agent on Project Grindstone but is involvment is unclear and I have no confirmation of the association with "Cami".&nbsp; Marino have no confirmation on identity, standing, or department.&nbsp; March seems to be working with Infenal Affairs and Janet but department is unclear.&nbsp; She does have status as a field researcher however, this much I can confirm.&nbsp; My suspicions are that VC is extra-planar but I'm not certain from where.</p>
<p>Very well Chuck, if my communication becomes too combersome ever let me know.&nbsp; I could get equipment to improve my connection but it would take time, I could also maybe have it constructed but that would take much, much longer but it would be safest.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 21:25</strong></p>
<p>That could be a good idea, if you end up connecting to different access points while getting new information then it could get cumbersome. We'll have to discuss it further amongst ourselves but that could be very useful further down the line.</p>
<p>Could you remind me what VC is?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 22:35</strong></p>
<p>VC is someone that has been met with regularly outside of UMAD facilities by researchers at the Wizard's Whimsy in town.</p>
<p>I say regularly but there seems to be no schedule.&nbsp; Also I accidently said VC I meant SC…</p>
<p>You can tell I haven't slept.&nbsp; Working on this in combination with my regular work has been...exhausting.</p>
<p>The rotational error on the code is almost completely worked out...I think.&nbsp; It's hard to tell, it all comes out as code afterall.&nbsp; Also, do we have an idea for at least one last member?&nbsp; Do we have a plan for who will be in which department?</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 22:45</strong></p>
<p>No problem, we all get tired sometimes, make sure to take care of yourself Peach, don't over-exert yourself. We have an idea for someone, but they haven't been online in a while. In regards to departments, I've decided to go with Alchemy, and I know TheShades has gone for Aetherial Studies, Snow for Necromancy and Brandon for Culture</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 22:54</strong></p>
<p>We're also looking at AgentMajin for the last spot, but he's hard to get ahold of. We might be looking at others, but we'll see.</p>
<p>And I agree, please get some rest. If you're too tired, you stand a better chance of slipping up and getting caught, so rest up</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 23:01</strong></p>
<p>A pinch of alchemist dust and I'll be fine.&nbsp; What is Butcher doing?</p>
<p>Looks like he reached out.&nbsp; It'll be good to have a team that can see every department.&nbsp; Still waiting on him to respond to me.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Yesterday at 23:37</strong></p>
<p>Sadly, it's a no-go. Majin has a super packed schedule with work, so he's unable to help. He's promised to not mention you, so we should be safe. Now we seek someone else to fill that last spot</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Yesterday at 23:38</strong></p>
<p>Unfortunate but I'm sure we'll find the sixth person sooner or later</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 23:38</strong></p>
<p>That's disappointing.&nbsp; Any leads on whom you might ask?</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Yesterday at 23:39</strong></p>
<p>We're working on it</p>
