<p>Peach, just to let you know, we nearly had a Leak. We had to bring Kemist in, cause they Blabbed about your DM since they needed help solving it. We got them to delete the Post, but Argent did see it, so we're not sure how bad this ended up being.</p>
<p><strong>Kemist stonks — Today at 17:24</strong></p>
<p>I think i may have compromised the entire mission-</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 17:24</strong></p>
<p>We'll see what the Damage is soon. But for now. All we can do is keep at it and see what happens.</p>

<p>@Peach Might want to get on soon and see the recent posts.</p>
<p><span class="text-big"><mark class="pen-red"><strong>[Peach leaves the Project Grindstone server]</strong></mark></span></p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:32</strong></p>
<p>I've left the server.&nbsp; There definitely was a leak.&nbsp; I'm pretty sure they know I'm not alone now too.&nbsp; I'm sure they suspected me but a public leak means they will be more aggressive to save face as well.&nbsp; I can no longer be on the server.&nbsp; This means their security will be heightened which will restrict my movement some and I'm sure a the manhunt will begin to implicate others.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:33</strong></p>
<p>Crap... This is bad</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 20:33</strong></p>
<p>Yes it is</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 20:33</strong></p>
<p>surely they'll be suspious you left the server tho?</p>
<p><strong>Kemist stonks — Today at 20:34</strong></p>
<p>Welp</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:34</strong></p>
<p>The name peach was used and Necromancy isn't incompetent.&nbsp; I assumed they might have suspected me earlier but weren't certain if others were implicated yet.&nbsp; Now they definitely are.</p>
<p><strong>Kemist stonks — Today at 20:35</strong></p>
<p>ive fucked up then-</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 20:35</strong></p>
<p>Do they know you directly? Like your connection to the name Peach?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:35</strong></p>
<p>They'll likely question Kemist first, since he blabbed</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 20:35</strong></p>
<p>Are they hunting us now then?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:36</strong></p>
<p>You've only fucked up if we can't use this to our advantage somehow.&nbsp; I think we should think of how to turn this around and benefit from it.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 20:36</strong></p>
<p>I guess now they'll be scurrying</p>
<p><strong>Kemist stonks — Today at 20:36</strong></p>
<p>hmm</p>
<p>we could give them false info to change their perspective?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:37</strong></p>
<p>I might have another idea. They're after me anyway, so make me a scapegoat</p>
<p>I'll say I dug in and found info they were after me, and that I made the peach account to find others to dig deeper</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:38</strong></p>
<p>Their investigation will limit my movement but their activity will mean that our actions are more public.&nbsp; We could use this for evidentiary support for gaining more allies after future recruitment rounds.</p>
<p>What if instead you used this opprotunity to gain trust?</p>
<p><strong>Kemist stonks — Today at 20:39</strong></p>
<p>like giving info to gain allies or do you mean something else?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:39</strong></p>
<p>How?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:39</strong></p>
<p>Say you found Peach but don't know who they are yet.&nbsp; Try to be a mole.</p>
<p><strong>Kemist stonks — Today at 20:39</strong></p>
<p>ah ok</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:40</strong></p>
<p>A double-agent.</p>
<p><strong>Kemist stonks — Today at 20:40</strong></p>
<p>big brain-</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:40</strong></p>
<p>To be fair, we don't know much about you, so we wouldn't be lying. I can take that role</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 20:40</strong></p>
<p>Be aware this is a big gamble Shades. If you get discovered…</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:40</strong></p>
<p>It would be risky however. One wrong move and they could shut you out completely, or much worse.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:41</strong></p>
<p>Again, they're after me anyway, so I have the best chance</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 20:41</strong></p>
<p>Just try not to martyr yourself please</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:41</strong></p>
<p>Don't plan on it</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 20:41</strong></p>
<p>I'd say it would be better for Stonks to be the double agent though since they were the original one to say the leak</p>
<p>otherwise they could take out two of us rather than one</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:42</strong></p>
<p>It does little good to sacrifice unnecessarily.&nbsp; Be smart and keep safe with anything you do or say.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:42</strong></p>
<p>I'd advise against that, chuck. He's inexperienced and young. That could make him easily manipulated</p>
<p><strong>Kemist stonks — Today at 20:43</strong></p>
<p>Agreed</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:43</strong></p>
<p>No offense, kemist</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:43</strong></p>
<p>Are any of us really experienced in this?</p>
<p><strong>Kemist stonks — Today at 20:43</strong></p>
<p>non taken :D</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 20:43</strong></p>
<p>Heh no lol</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:43</strong></p>
<p>But we know Kemist is 14 years old. That age can make him a liability</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 20:43</strong></p>
<p>Should we end up needing to sacrifice someone…we’ll cross that bridge when we get there</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 20:43</strong></p>
<p>Well only if you're sure then, and keep us posted. Maybe add another channel so you can post what UMAD says to you?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:44</strong></p>
<p>I like that idea</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:44</strong></p>
<p>They will likely reach out to Kemist.&nbsp; They are no fools though.&nbsp; You'll need to keep playing it off as the communication when nowhere.&nbsp; Send evidence if you can once they reach out.&nbsp; They will also notice however that you deleted your message which will raise suspicion.&nbsp; They will look at time stamps, anything they can find on you, anything.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 20:45</strong></p>
<p>We will need to be wary then</p>
<p><strong>Kemist stonks — Today at 20:45</strong></p>
<p>idea we could make them think they got really valuable info when in reality its all just some&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:46</strong></p>
<p>Only issue is timestamps</p>
<p>Yeah</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 20:47</strong></p>
<p>What did you find from the quill?</p>
<p><strong>Kemist stonks — Today at 20:47</strong></p>
<p>i could just seem like im working alone but in reality its an inside mission?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:47</strong></p>
<p>Nah, they won't buy that</p>
<p>You name-dropped peach, so they know you're not alone</p>
<p><strong>Kemist stonks — Today at 20:48</strong></p>
<p>oh dam your right</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 20:48</strong></p>
<p>they don't know if you have any connection to us besides looking into mutual friends, which they might already have done</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:48</strong></p>
<p>They can only do that if they friended all of us</p>
<p><strong>Kemist stonks — Today at 20:49</strong></p>
<p>hmm lemme unfriend you just incase</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:49</strong></p>
<p>Good idea</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 20:49</strong></p>
<p>They can’t look at mutual friend unless we’re friends with them. Did you friend any of the staff?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:49</strong></p>
<p>Nope</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 20:49</strong></p>
<p>Then we should be good!</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:50</strong></p>
<p>I'll say this once, they have the ability to offer you quite a bit but what they offer will determine the value of finding me to them.&nbsp; As long as they think there is not a net loss it will be in their ability to do so.&nbsp; This can help us determine how serious the investigation is but also makes you a real risk in the future.&nbsp; Being a double agent means we should all agree that you are up to it and won't turn sides part way through this war.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:51</strong></p>
<p>I don't like being a target for experimentation, so I'm not up for joining them</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 20:51</strong></p>
<p>I mean, I could probably give the double agent thing a shot. I'm all for this team.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 20:51</strong></p>
<p>No Snow. You’ve been pretty active and helpful. The team needs you</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 20:51</strong></p>
<p>I could also, UMAD already sees me as a bit of a golden boy</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 20:52</strong></p>
<p>^^^</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:52</strong></p>
<p>Chuck might be a good call as well. He's not so easily swayed either</p>
<p><strong>Kemist stonks — Today at 20:52</strong></p>
<p>i would but i am a child so my i may be manipulated but idk</p>
<p>chuck seems like the best person who could do it</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 20:52</strong></p>
<p>Chuck is the fan favorite lol</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 20:53</strong></p>
<p>Lol</p>
<p><strong>Kemist stonks — Today at 20:53</strong></p>
<p>y e s</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:53</strong></p>
<p>There is no real way of determining character like this so I say whomever goes should have a majority vote.&nbsp; There are twelve of you.&nbsp; I will also say that whoever goes should recieve all of our support in this.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 20:53</strong></p>
<p>I'll need a bit of help to compose a message to UMAD but I think I could do it</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:54</strong></p>
<p>I may have become the De Facto leader of this little team, but a good leader knows who's best for the job. I vote Chuck</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 20:54</strong></p>
<p>I also vote chuck</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 20:54</strong></p>
<p>I have faith that Chuck's got this</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 20:54</strong></p>
<p>God be with you Chuck</p>
<p><strong>Kemist stonks — Today at 20:54</strong></p>

<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 20:54</strong></p>
<p>#chuck2021</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:54</strong></p>
<p>Lol</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 20:54</strong></p>
<p>well shit</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 20:55</strong></p>
<p>#chuckforpresident</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 20:55</strong></p>
<p>welp I've had experience being a teacher's pet, this should be interesting</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:55</strong></p>
<p>I see six votes.&nbsp; Any others?</p>
<p><strong>Kemist stonks — Today at 20:55</strong></p>
<p>#godbewithchuck</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:55</strong></p>
<p>Most of the others are offline right now</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:55</strong></p>
<p>Even one?</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Today at 20:55</strong></p>
<p>i'm conflicted</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 20:55</strong></p>
<p>1 more person for majority</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 20:55</strong></p>
<p>It's understandable</p>
<p>The only other person I could think of is me. UMAD thinks I'm a lone party</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Today at 20:57</strong></p>
<p>but the leak has already established that the person taking the fall + becoming the double agent doesnt work alone</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:57</strong></p>
<p>Even with a decision I think you should be very certain of your decision.&nbsp; I've got some hand made constructs out of reject parts.&nbsp; They are a well funded government organization</p>
<p>.</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Today at 20:57</strong></p>
<p>shades is already on the radar, so this could be a good way to keep the attention focused on him and away from anyone else on our team</p>
<p>it could also change UMAD's mind about him, because from what I hear they don't hold him in high regards right now</p>
<p><strong>Kemist stonks — Today at 20:57</strong></p>
<p>i n t e r e s t i n g</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 20:57</strong></p>
<p>What would we need the construct for Peach?</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 20:58</strong></p>
<p>UMAD is already watching me, they've told me. This could keep Shades safe</p>
<p>At least for a bit longer</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 20:58</strong></p>
<p>personally, we need to keep the attention off shades right now</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Today at 20:58</strong></p>
<p>chuck is the golden boy, so that gives them the highest chance of success; this could, as chuck has just said, divert attention from shades, and make sure he's still also being considered for a position</p>
<p><strong>Kemist stonks — Today at 20:58</strong></p>
<p>Yea</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 20:59</strong></p>
<p>So you're voting for Chuck?</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Today at 20:59</strong></p>
<p>with all of these things considered, i'll have to pick the safer option</p>
<p>yeah, chuck has my vote</p>
<p><strong>Kemist stonks — Today at 20:59</strong></p>
<p>ayy</p>
<p>#chuckparty</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 21:00</strong></p>
<p>ok, so we have a majority for chuck</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Today at 21:00</strong></p>
<p>we can't risk shades at this point, and chuck is in a pretty safe spot rn</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 21:00</strong></p>
<p>Ok cool</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 21:00</strong></p>
<p>Very well, if you're certain.&nbsp; Just be prepared for whatever comes Chuck.&nbsp; I need to go but when I get back we can talk about the quill notes.</p>
<p><strong>Kemist stonks — Today at 21:00</strong></p>
<p>Bai</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Today at 21:01</strong></p>
<p>Alright</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 21:01</strong></p>
<p>Good luck with the meeting</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 21:01</strong></p>
<p>Right then @TheShades I'll need a channel to post what UMAD says to me</p>
<p><strong>Kemist stonks — Today at 21:01</strong></p>
<p>Gl</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Today at 21:01</strong></p>
<p>take care!!</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 21:01</strong></p>
<p>Good luck Peach</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Today at 21:01</strong></p>
<p>we need to discuss your approach to this in more detail</p>
<p><strong>Kemist stonks — Today at 21:01</strong></p>
<p>hope you have a good meeting</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 21:01</strong></p>
<p>I'll set it up when I get home</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Today at 21:01</strong></p>
<p>what story we're giving UMAD and how, I mean</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 21:01</strong></p>
<p>Yeah definitely</p>
<p>For that it might be best to wait until Peach comes back before we finalise anything, Peach was mentioned in the leak so I don't want to put them in danger</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Today at 21:03</strong></p>
<p>Yeah</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 21:03</strong></p>
<p>Looks like we’re in agreement then</p>
<p>What is it Peach said…ah yes. May your walls be salted and your floors damp. I think</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 21:04</strong></p>
<p>Im good with chuck as well as shades</p>
<p><strong>Eris — Today at 21:10</strong></p>
<p>I’m a bit late but I support Chuck :sweat_smile:</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 21:16</strong></p>
<p>I just Realized: We need to Delete the Peach Channel in the Grindstone Server. They could easily find that, and expose us.</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 21:17</strong></p>
<p>they probably already know about that right?</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 21:17</strong></p>
<p>Well Rashos and Derpa do but not UMAD</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 21:18</strong></p>
<p>Not sure, but the sooner we get rid of it, the better.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 21:18</strong></p>
<p>How do you propose we delete an entire channel in a server we don’t own?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 21:19</strong></p>
<p>I'm not sure, but something needs to be done. That channel is wide out in the open for them to find, and there's a TON of stuff they could use to hang most of us here with</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 21:20</strong></p>
<p>https://tenor.com/view/phoenix-wright-ace-attorney-sweating-reaction-sweat-gif-18802913</p>
<p>Tenor</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 21:20</strong></p>
<p>assuming they couldn't see the channel before, what makes you think they can see the channel now?</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 21:21</strong></p>
<p>…That’s true</p>
<p>Peach had to add us before remember?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 21:21</strong></p>
<p>It's in their server. Odds are good they could find it eventually. It's only a matter of time</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 21:21</strong></p>
<p>We have the transcript, we could just delete what we ourselves said</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 21:21</strong></p>
<p>especially since they now know what to look for.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 21:21</strong></p>
<p>With Peach gone, it would be impossible to find it</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 21:21</strong></p>
<p>what the hell did i miss while i was asleep?</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 21:21</strong></p>
<p>with peach gone, noone can be added to that channel</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 21:21</strong></p>
<p>That would take a long time</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Today at 21:22</strong></p>
<p>if peach could add us to the channel, peach should also be able to erase the channel, right?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 21:22</strong></p>
<p>We had a Leak, and now shit has hit the fan</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Today at 21:22</strong></p>
<p>oh right, peach has left</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 21:22</strong></p>
<p>they left that discord</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 21:22</strong></p>
<p>oh fuck me</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 21:23</strong></p>
<p>Hey Peach could you get Rashos or Derpa to delete the channel we were all on? We have a back up of everything said, so it's safe to get rid of it.</p>
<p>And now that you're on this channel, that one is irrelevant.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 23:01</strong></p>
<p>I could see if I can collapse any traces of involvement there.</p>
<p><strong>Kemist stonks — Today at 23:01</strong></p>
<p>your back :0</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 23:01</strong></p>
<p>Welcome back and oh I hope so</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 23:02</strong></p>
<p>The Sooner the better. If they somehow find that Channel, all of us are screwed.</p>
<p><strong>Kemist stonks — Today at 23:02</strong></p>
<p>well all except the newly joined ones but yea</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 23:03</strong></p>
<p>With as many of us as they would catch, the ones left would be left aimless and it would fall like a house of cards at that point</p>
<p><strong>Kemist stonks — Today at 23:05</strong></p>
<p>dam thats philosophical-</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 23:06</strong></p>
<p>Quill news, the next stage of recruitment starts within two of your hours.</p>
<p>Has everyone been caught up on everything discussed so far?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 23:07</strong></p>
<p>For the most part. Though this could be bad timing for me. A Storm is hitting here and there's a chance I lose power soon.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 23:07</strong></p>
<p>So far so good</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 23:07</strong></p>
<p>A number of the researchers are getting involved now that weren't before.&nbsp; For one, Hanford is.&nbsp; She is a member of Alchemy but I have personally never seen her.</p>
<p><strong>Kemist stonks — Today at 23:10</strong></p>
<p>i n t e r e s t i n g</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 23:10</strong></p>
<p>Alchemy seems to be investigating, with the support of culture, cognition and perception.&nbsp; A lot of notes here on altered states of conciousness.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 23:11</strong></p>
<p>So like a sleeper agent?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 23:11</strong></p>
<p>So they're making some kind of Drug to get people "High" as we call it.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 23:12</strong></p>
<p>More like they are developing compounds to further understand what external influences influence certain responses.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 23:13</strong></p>
<p>Maybe seeking something to control or manipulate people through external stimuli</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 23:13</strong></p>
<p>This might not be at all relevant to the project but it does raise concerns.&nbsp; Not yet have I found anything that the interdepartmental project suggests the need for this.</p>
<p><strong>Kemist stonks — Today at 23:13</strong></p>
<p>is this substance one that makes the user feel as though they are in a higher consciousness?</p>
<p>or is it not a substance at all?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 23:14</strong></p>
<p>Varying sensory inhibitions to find how select media and sensory data effects pleasure and attention.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 23:15</strong></p>
<p>Get us Happy and Complacent, it seems</p>
<p><strong>Kemist stonks — Today at 23:15</strong></p>
<p>so it’s a form of self reward?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 23:15</strong></p>
<p>And to Focus on whatever task they give us for maximum efficiency</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 23:16</strong></p>
<p>so the matrix.</p>

<p>They're using videos and media and such and putting in waves to make us complacent. Lovely.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 23:16</strong></p>
<p>In a sense, but not the exact same</p>
<p><strong>Kemist stonks — Today at 23:16</strong></p>
<p>hmm it sounds more of sensory deprivation..</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 23:19</strong></p>
<p>Arousal, valence, and attention come up often.</p>
<p>They find positive valence does not necessarily produce increased attention but heightened arousal almost always does.</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 23:20</strong></p>
<p>oh my</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 23:21</strong></p>
<p>Odd, in our world, Arousal often decreases attention, since we're then focused on deal with said arousal</p>
<p><strong>Kemist stonks — Today at 23:21</strong></p>
<p>so what your saying is they’ve made a high tech vibrator?-</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 23:21</strong></p>
<p>Fear is almost as effective as joy for instance.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 23:21</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, but Fear has Drawbacks. Joy is easier to work with</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 23:21</strong></p>
<p>Not that kind of arousal I'm pretty certain…</p>
<p><strong>Kemist stonks — Today at 23:21</strong></p>
<p>got it..</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 23:21</strong></p>
<p>There is a sense of entertainment when it comes to horror and fear</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 23:22</strong></p>
<p>My conclusion is they want to find a way to maximize attention.&nbsp; Perhaps it's for retention?</p>
<p><strong>Kemist stonks — Today at 23:22</strong></p>
<p>our human emotions have been number since we’ve almost dominated this world so we make our senses feel artificially</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 23:23</strong></p>
<p>Again, likely Efficiency. That is one thing they strive for, so keeping us focused on a task would be right up their alley</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 23:23</strong></p>
<p>Second phase of recruitment? As in they’re bringing in more people or another test incoming?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 23:24</strong></p>
<p>With every new puzzle, more and more people are hearing about this. If the right people spread the word, this could blow up big, giving UMAD all the test Subjects they need</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 23:24</strong></p>
<p>It looks like more people followed by a second stage of the second mission.&nbsp; I'm not certain when this second stage will begin.</p>
<p>How very Culture…</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 23:24</strong></p>
<p>Considering the researchers involved, it's no suprise</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 23:25</strong></p>
<p>Hmm. There's a lot of big names in this so them using their platforms to get more recruits is probably going to be another step. Maybe a collab.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 23:25</strong></p>
<p>So what we do know is they are interested in attention, will, and conciousness while also being multi-planar and utilizing multiple entertainers from your world.&nbsp; Also they want lots of subjects.</p>
<p><strong>Kemist stonks — Today at 23:26</strong></p>
<p>interesting by subjects do you mean people/followers?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 23:26</strong></p>
<p>I'm not gonna lie, this sounds like bad news. They might be trying to find something to basically control the human population through complacency, and put us to work for their purposes</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 23:27</strong></p>
<p>I do know Researcher Hyles and Researcher March were discussing combining their efforts for the application process but I assumed this was more of the same.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 23:27</strong></p>
<p>I have a horrible feeling this might be something to do with that experiment they tend to involve Shades in</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 23:27</strong></p>
<p>That likely means they'll be doing a broadcast together to promote the project. Seems the most likely plan</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 23:31</strong></p>
<p>I do know whatever the two are doing it'll be sometime soon.&nbsp; Although that is a very vague estimate.</p>
<p>Should I keep the quill where it is or move it?</p>
<p><strong>Kemist stonks — Today at 23:36</strong></p>
<p>Engineering</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 23:36</strong></p>
<p>I say engineering.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 23:36</strong></p>
<p>I agree</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 23:36</strong></p>
<p>We're thinking Engineering, given we've learned everything we can about the test. Time to see what they're up to over there.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 23:37</strong></p>
<p>We don't know anything from there and new info would be great.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 23:38</strong></p>
<p>Do we want to round it off after with aetherial studies?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 23:38</strong></p>
<p>Sounds like a Plan to me!</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 23:38</strong></p>
<p>That would be good</p>
<p><strong>Kemist stonks — Today at 23:38</strong></p>
<p>y e s</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 23:42</strong></p>
<p>Id almost suggest necromancy but after the leak im sure their security is back on high alert. Im good with engineering. Seeing more on meer soot is interesting</p>
