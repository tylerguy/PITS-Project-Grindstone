<p>How very kind of you Chuck.&nbsp; Also I have no idea how I talked myself into doing that.&nbsp; It was kind of a RUSH!&nbsp; The plan was a good one.&nbsp; I think if we did anything differently it would be real bad.&nbsp; The rats' level of communication is still lacking so that works to our advantage.&nbsp; Sadly I'm not sure what UMAD will do with the experiment as it's becoming costly due to their frequent escapes.</p>

<p>i see</p>
<p>have you gotten the print?</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 00:39</strong></p>
<p>Good to hear of the success</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:40</strong></p>
<p>We have something to work with.&nbsp; I just need to get a locksmith to make us a something.&nbsp; Next time Janet leaves though we should have a plan.&nbsp; We are getting into that desk.</p>

<p>Hey, if you didn't get caught, that's a win in my book, and getting the Print is a Bonus. We'll keep an eye out for when she streams again</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:43</strong></p>
<p>It's a small victory but still a victory.&nbsp; I know someone I can go to.&nbsp; I'll see about talking to them tomorrow.</p>
<p>It'll likely take time to make the key but I'll let you know once it's ready.</p>

<p>Also, you may not know this, but if you are running certain applications, Discord will show you as using them, and that's happening on your name right now. We're seeing this as we speak:</p>

<p>Interesting!</p>

<p>also, I think zella still needs to be added when you have the time</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 00:47</strong></p>
<p>I'm no curious how you are able to access Minecraft using your constructs.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:48</strong></p>
<p>Yes, I think I found a work around to use this medium but I don't know how to use it yet for planar exploration.</p>
<p>My conclusion is I can run the medium but I cannot use it for safe projection for planar viewing.</p>
<p>None the less I think I enjoy it.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 00:50</strong></p>
<p>Nice</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 00:50</strong></p>
<p>It's a fun app to play. I suspect UMAD will be making a world in this app for us to explore, and hiding the Characters in said world. If I were to explain how it works on our end, It might get REALLY confusing.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:51</strong></p>
<p>Although how I interact with it and how you interact with it might be very different.&nbsp; I learned more about user interfaces recently.&nbsp; It must be very convenient for you to navigate discord and these tools on your end.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 00:53</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, we have parts that allow us to type and a cursor we move around with what we call a "Mouse" (Not to be confused with the animal). We strive for convenience in our world.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:55</strong></p>
<p>My "display" is much more complicated.&nbsp; Imagine a 3 dimensional display but the relevant data appears not necessarily in a convenient way.&nbsp; Must of what I see is various figures.&nbsp; Visual data comes to me very, very slowly.&nbsp; I'm trying to interact with minecraft but things happen far before I realize they do.&nbsp; The action information in code comes in and then the screen changes suddenly.&nbsp; In addition to that the audio project sometimes before the video.</p>
<p>It's sometimes very stressful honestly</p>
<p>And these damn chill keep making me disappear and appear where I started.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 00:57</strong></p>
<p>The undead in minecraft are vicious creatures. It's best to find a place to hide when night falls</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:57</strong></p>
<p>your games are complicated.&nbsp; What's the goal of this?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 00:58</strong></p>
<p>To build and explore mostly. There is a final battle, but the game never actually ends.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 00:58</strong></p>
<p>There is no real goal. One can build and create whatever one likes. There is a technical "ending" where you have to slay a dragon, but you can just continue playing however you enjoy playing it</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:01</strong></p>
<p>Why are you slaying the dragon?&nbsp; Is it terrorizing livestock?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 01:01</strong></p>
<p>The Lore for the game is very subtle. But it's clear it's something that needs to be stopped</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:01</strong></p>
<p>Giant spiders make me uncomfortable.&nbsp; Perhaps I should explore minecraft another interval.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 01:03</strong></p>
<p>The dragon lies in a separate dimension within the game, its purpose is unclear but one prevailing theory is that it is holing the citizens of that dimension hostage, as when you slay it you are told that you have "Freed The End", The End being the dimension in which the dragon resides</p>

<p>Hey Peach. Does this symbol mean anything to you? ~))}*{((~</p>

<p>Alright Peach I sent Kemist Stonks your way. Let's hope they solve the test</p>
