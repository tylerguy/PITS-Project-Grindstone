<h2>8th August 2021</h2>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:38</strong></p>
<p>How very kind of you Chuck.&nbsp; Also I have no idea how I talked myself into doing that.&nbsp; It was kind of a RUSH!&nbsp; The plan was a good one.&nbsp; I think if we did anything differently it would be real bad.&nbsp; The rats' level of communication is still lacking so that works to our advantage.&nbsp; Sadly I'm not sure what UMAD will do with the experiment as it's becoming costly due to their frequent escapes.</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Today at 00:39</strong></p>
<p>i see</p>
<p>have you gotten the print?</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 00:39</strong></p>
<p>Good to hear of the success</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:40</strong></p>
<p>We have something to work with.&nbsp; I just need to get a locksmith to make us a something.&nbsp; Next time Janet leaves though we should have a plan.&nbsp; We are getting into that desk.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 00:42</strong></p>
<p>Hey, if you didn't get caught, that's a win in my book, and getting the Print is a Bonus. We'll keep an eye out for when she streams again</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:43</strong></p>
<p>It's a small victory but still a victory.&nbsp; I know someone I can go to.&nbsp; I'll see about talking to them tomorrow.</p>
<p>It'll likely take time to make the key but I'll let you know once it's ready.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 00:46</strong></p>
<p>Also, you may not know this, but if you are running certain applications, Discord will show you as using them, and that's happening on your name right now. We're seeing this as we speak:</p>

<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:46</strong></p>
<p>Interesting!</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Today at 00:47</strong></p>
<p>also, I think zella still needs to be added when you have the time</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 00:47</strong></p>
<p>I'm no curious how you are able to access Minecraft using your constructs.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:48</strong></p>
<p>Yes, I think I found a work around to use this medium but I don't know how to use it yet for planar exploration.</p>
<p>My conclusion is I can run the medium but I cannot use it for safe projection for planar viewing.</p>
<p>None the less I think I enjoy it.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 00:50</strong></p>
<p>Nice</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 00:50</strong></p>
<p>It's a fun app to play. I suspect UMAD will be making a world in this app for us to explore, and hiding the Characters in said world. If I were to explain how it works on our end, It might get REALLY confusing.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:51</strong></p>
<p>Although how I interact with it and how you interact with it might be very different.&nbsp; I learned more about user interfaces recently.&nbsp; It must be very convenient for you to navigate discord and these tools on your end.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 00:53</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, we have parts that allow us to type and a cursor we move around with what we call a "Mouse" (Not to be confused with the animal). We strive for convenience in our world.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:55</strong></p>
<p>My "display" is much more complicated.&nbsp; Imagine a 3 dimensional display but the relevant data appears not necessarily in a convenient way.&nbsp; Must of what I see is various figures.&nbsp; Visual data comes to me very, very slowly.&nbsp; I'm trying to interact with minecraft but things happen far before I realize they do.&nbsp; The action information in code comes in and then the screen changes suddenly.&nbsp; In addition to that the audio project sometimes before the video.</p>
<p>It's sometimes very stressful honestly</p>
<p>And these damn chill keep making me disappear and appear where I started.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 00:57</strong></p>
<p>The undead in minecraft are vicious creatures. It's best to find a place to hide when night falls</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:57</strong></p>
<p>your games are complicated.&nbsp; What's the goal of this?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 00:58</strong></p>
<p>To build and explore mostly. There is a final battle, but the game never actually ends.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 00:58</strong></p>
<p>There is no real goal. One can build and create whatever one likes. There is a technical "ending" where you have to slay a dragon, but you can just continue playing however you enjoy playing it</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:01</strong></p>
<p>Why are you slaying the dragon?&nbsp; Is it terrorizing livestock?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 01:01</strong></p>
<p>The Lore for the game is very subtle. But it's clear it's something that needs to be stopped</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:01</strong></p>
<p>Giant spiders make me uncomfortable.&nbsp; Perhaps I should explore minecraft another interval.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 01:03</strong></p>
<p>The dragon lies in a separate dimension within the game, its purpose is unclear but one prevailing theory is that it is holing the citizens of that dimension hostage, as when you slay it you are told that you have "Freed The End", The End being the dimension in which the dragon resides</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — 05:28</strong></p>
<p>Hey Peach. Does this symbol mean anything to you? ~))}*{((~</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — 16:10</strong></p>
<p>Alright Peach I sent Kemist Stonks your way. Let's hope they solve the test</p>
<h2>9th August 2021</h2>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — 17:50</strong></p>
<p>Hey Peach, do you have access to the Project Grindstone website where we're pulling everything from? I know it's limited in what you can see, but I wanted to know if you've seen the letter sent by Michael Hope in the Terms and Condition tab and wondered if you had an inkling of what town it went to.</p>
<p>It was sent to a mayor Augustine</p>
<h2>11th August 2021</h2>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:10</strong></p>
<p>I hate rats.&nbsp; I'm back everyone.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 02:11</strong></p>
<p>Welcome back! Have you been well?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:13</strong></p>
<p>Exhausted.&nbsp; grabbed what I could not long ago from Necromancy and took the quill.&nbsp; Security has increased again.&nbsp; Not long after the rat incident a few found their way into my room and destroyed some of my equipment.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 02:15</strong></p>
<p>Aw that's terrible! Glad they didn't get you though.</p>
<p>I guess next in line for discussion is what you found from necromancy and where to move the quill to next.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:27</strong></p>
<p>First, it seems like the bulk of the next round of recruitment will begin in two intervals.&nbsp; I learned that plane is being "made appropriate" for continued use after your application process.</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 02:28</strong></p>
<p>two intervals?</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 02:28</strong></p>
<p>Two days for us</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 02:28</strong></p>
<p>oh k</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:31</strong></p>
<p>It seems like they also assisted infernal affairs recently with attempting to destroy a large number of files.&nbsp; This is fairly unusual for UMAD.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 02:31</strong></p>
<p>Oof it makes one wonder what's on those files</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 02:31</strong></p>
<p>Guess they have things they want to keep really secret</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 02:32</strong></p>
<p>Yeah</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 02:32</strong></p>
<p>Is there any way to get any of the files that's being destroyed?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:32</strong></p>
<p>how Destroyed we talking here?</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 02:32</strong></p>
<p>like time machine bad or what?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:35</strong></p>
<p>In all departments information is either redacted or is made in error still allowed to be kept very visible to see where error was made.&nbsp; This is usually by simply running a line through text.&nbsp; In this case they attempted to destroy many files including many of a higher clearance.&nbsp; Higher clearance items aren't very easy to destroy, while some lower clearance items might simply be written on parchment and can be burned higher clearance documents often have means of easy location should they be stolen.&nbsp; This is typically aetherial in nature which would require dispelling.&nbsp; Even so auras remain persistent in a weaker state for some time.&nbsp; This is very important for investigations when a caster is involved since everyone typically has their own unique aetherial signature.&nbsp; It's a sort of style unique to them and their casting.&nbsp; Sometimes a particular shortcut they might use etc.</p>
<p>If these were destroyed then they haven't been entirely destroyed yet.&nbsp; They were likely destroyed in the in the lead room.&nbsp; Recovery is possible but would be tricky and the lead room degrades auras quickly.&nbsp; This means we might be able to create impressions of the partial documents through a combination aeonization and divination magics.&nbsp; The documents would be illegible in their current state but with enough effort we might be able to find something useful in them.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:39</strong></p>
<p>Then let's do it! If they're trying to get rid of it, there's a reason for it</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 02:39</strong></p>
<p>sounds doable</p>
<p>tricky but doable</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 02:39</strong></p>
<p>Hey I'm willing to try and help decipher any new information that comes this way</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 02:39</strong></p>
<p>Same</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 02:40</strong></p>
<p>Must be super important in some way or another so I'm down</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:40</strong></p>
<p>Cracks Knuckles Time to Crack some Codes</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 02:41</strong></p>
<p>it's time to build up.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:41</strong></p>
<p>This is where things get tricky...&nbsp; The lead room is used for higher clearance documents like the personnel files that went missing.&nbsp; We have no idea how much time we really have and the longer we take the more the files will fade away and we will have less to work with.&nbsp; I would need to find a way into the higher clearance room or have a new clearance document made for me.&nbsp; Then even if I make it in I'd need a considerable amount of time to record as many impressions as possible without being caught.&nbsp; Finally, once I have the impressions it would not be like a cipher, these would be incomplete documents and might require some ingenuity to recover fully.&nbsp; Even then some of the files may be redacted.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:43</strong></p>
<p>It's a risk, but I get the sense that this is too important to not do. We have to decide fast: Is this worth that big a risk?</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 02:43</strong></p>
<p>i say yes</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 02:43</strong></p>
<p>I think it is. Kinda like with necromancy, now is the best time</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 02:44</strong></p>
<p>it's tricky but as the shades said it's too important.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:44</strong></p>
<p>I had they key made but it came with a little trouble.&nbsp; My guy I thought would go without asking questions, it's just a simple key.&nbsp; He knows I work at UMAD and is suspicious.&nbsp; I'm worried he might be a problem later too.&nbsp; He did seem to suggest that he might need additional insurance in the future…</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 02:45</strong></p>
<p>oh boy.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:45</strong></p>
<p>The planar head is already installed.&nbsp; Do we place the quill and wait for them to be cycled out again or do we look for another way?</p>
<p>Also, how do we buy time?&nbsp; Also, also we don't know how a few of the departments are involved yet.</p>
<p>We really need to plan where our resources are going.</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 02:46</strong></p>
<p>True</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 02:47</strong></p>
<p>What's the side effect of those potions you got? The one that heightens intelligence.</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 02:48</strong></p>
<p>he's gone</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 02:48</strong></p>
<p>Well, rats got to the equipment. They could have in and out connection because of it.</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 02:49</strong></p>
<p>True</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 03:03</strong></p>
<p>Also peach, just to remind me, you did get a high clearance key of some kind right now right? Could we use that to get to the lead room with less problems and get a new one with the new planar head?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:02</strong></p>
<p>I think everything is fixed now.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 18:03</strong></p>
<p>Good to know. We got a lot to discuss today, given what you told us last night</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:05</strong></p>
<p>I'll try to answer all I can.&nbsp; Do you want me to talk in the PITS chat or here?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 18:06</strong></p>
<p>Wait what? Do you have access to that?</p>
<p><span class="text-big"><mark class="pen-red"><strong>[Peach moves to PITS server]</strong></mark></span></p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 18:10</strong></p>
<p>So I believe we need to discuss what to do with Planar, and the Due to be destroyed documents.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 18:26</strong></p>
<p>How risky would acquiring these documents be? And remember they would probably be in pieces</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:35</strong></p>
<p>Well...it's complicated.</p>
<p>The longer we wait the more they will degrade but I cannot make it into the lead room without proper clearance.&nbsp; That would be the first step.</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Today at 18:37</strong></p>
<p>would you be able to get that from janet's desk?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:38</strong></p>
<p>Infernal affairs will recognize me as whichever entity I hold the clearance for.&nbsp; They are some of the most impersonal personnel here.&nbsp; They are however pretty good at determining a fake.&nbsp; The extent we would need to go through to forge the item makes me believe we ought to go through channels to acquire someone else's.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 18:39</strong></p>
<p>I see, "Borrow" someone else's Clearance, so even if they do check to see who accessed it, it would be someone else taking the fall instead of you. Have anyone who you think would work?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:39</strong></p>
<p>+Unlikely.&nbsp; I do have information on how to acquire one as a department head thanks to our previous work but doing so would put us at risk.&nbsp; As soon as the department head attempts to use their higher clearance they will learn it does not work and that a new clearance was made.&nbsp; The best way to hide this is to request clearance while awaiting an incoming department head or to steal their clearance paperwork.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 18:41</strong></p>
<p>If we waited till the Head left, it might be too late, since they'll likely be starting the next phase tomorrow. We'll need to find a safe way to steal their paperwork now</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:41</strong></p>
<p>There isn't exactly a directory I can access without being a member of Admin or Infernal Affairs as to who has what level clearance.&nbsp; &nbsp; There are some who advertise their higher clearance but for the most part it is kept private.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 18:42</strong></p>
<p>For good reason.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:43</strong></p>
<p>Even with this clearance I could still be discovered if someone walked in on me.&nbsp; Also copying the documents would require appropriate tools which I'd need to acquire at aetherial studies.</p>
<p>This means I need to buy more time and I don't think rats will work in this instance.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 18:45</strong></p>
<p>So much to do, and not enough time to do it. We need to make a Plan and fast. I'll admit I'm a bit worried, knowing I'm likely in danger of being captured soon. I want to do what I can to either Prevent that, or to make sure the gears are in motion after it happens.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:46</strong></p>
<p>As long as accounting finds you are more useful left alone then you'll be fine.</p>
<p>Their word is very important for most decision making here.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 18:46</strong></p>
<p>True, but that'll only last so long, based on that message, so I'm taking no chances here</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:47</strong></p>
<p>What would you suggest to acquire the proper clearance?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 18:49</strong></p>
<p>This is where I falter here. I'm not the best with thinking on the Fly. If someone starts an Idea, I'm usually good of bouncing off of that, but trying to think from square one is where my Creativity tends to struggle, since I overthink a lot (I have a Mental Condition that causes my brain to be hyperactive). And worse yet, few of the others are on to give suggestions.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 18:51</strong></p>
<p>Didn't you mention earlier that you thought you had the resources to make a clearance document?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:51</strong></p>
<p>We could wait for the next planar head but we do not know how long that'll take.&nbsp; We might lose some important information but we should also consider taking some loses if necessary.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 18:53</strong></p>
<p>Wait a second I have an idea, would Researcher Hyles have the proper clearance?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:53</strong></p>
<p>To acquire, yes.&nbsp; It would require me using someone else's clearance.&nbsp; For instance, I could have a new clearance documents be issued to me but for the new head of the planar department.&nbsp; This would only be good until another replacement is requisitioned.&nbsp; Once a replacement is requisitioned the old clearance document becomes invalid.&nbsp; That's why the transition of department heads seemed like a good opportunity.&nbsp; If I did this while one was installed it would be very risky.</p>
<p>I don't have high enough clearance.&nbsp; I don't know about Researcher Hyles.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 18:55</strong></p>
<p>I was wondering because if he does then we could use the same tactic as we've done with Janet and you could try and grab something from his desk like a form of ID while he livestreams over in this plane.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 18:56</strong></p>
<p>Sounds like our best bet is to wait for now, even if means losing those destroyed docs. I guess I'm a bit Panicky after seeing my Name as a target for experimentation. It's been weighing on my mind a lot, to say the least.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:57</strong></p>
<p>I'm not certain if or where his office might be.&nbsp; I could start at infernal affairs but the inquiry will be recorded.</p>
<p><strong>Eris — Today at 18:58</strong></p>
<p>Is there no way at all getting the documents without clearance?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:59</strong></p>
<p>Maybe we should move the quill around and try to get into Janet's desk next opportunity?&nbsp; Maybe we should take a risk soon?&nbsp; I just worry that I won't be around long if we take too many risks.</p>
<p><strong>Eris — Today at 18:59</strong></p>
<p>I believe we should choose our priorities</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 19:00</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, I think we need to cut our losses and focus on moving the quill. This route of getting clearance comes with too many risks, and we're too early to be taking those kind of chances unless we know it's worth that risk</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 19:01</strong></p>
<p>Walking into the lead room absolutely isn't an option.&nbsp; Moving through by aetherial means is nearly impossible due to the lead.&nbsp; Physically breaking in however might be possible albeit extremely dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 19:02</strong></p>
<p>Hey Peach, question. What are the side effects of those potions?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 19:04</strong></p>
<p>Which, the one on the rats?&nbsp; Unclear, it's all still highly experimental.&nbsp; What I have seen is they are temporary in effect.&nbsp; The intention was to create something to improve fluid intelligence.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 19:06</strong></p>
<p>I agree with Shades. I think we're in the dark overall and moving the quill if nothing else gets us more information regarding the inner workings of UMAD and can tell us when better opportunities come, like when the new head of Planar comes in. At this point it might be too risky to make any larger moves, and moving the quill gets us somewhere rather than potentially getting you caught and the entire operation going pear-shaped.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 19:06</strong></p>
<p>So the question is where to move the quill then</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 19:07</strong></p>
<p>I think we were talking Planar, close to Janet's desk, since a lot is happening there right now.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 19:09</strong></p>
<p>We haven't looked into a few departments but we could always revisit old ones.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 19:11</strong></p>
<p>We're mainly focusing on what is relevant at the moment. Since some of the Departments are on high alert, we need to be careful what we're spying on.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Yesterday at 19:14</strong></p>
<p>Agreed. I say we stay close to Janet. Nothing seems to happen without her noticing so that’s our best bet for intel</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Yesterday at 19:15</strong></p>
<p>So Alchemy is on high alert due to the rats and necromancy has high security anyway. We could maybe learn more on the test if we move to Planar again. What departments are close to Janet's desk? In fact, what is the layout of UMAD that way we can have a clearer view on how to operate. A map would probably be best but you can describe it as well.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 19:19</strong></p>
<p>The UMAD tower has multiple floors.&nbsp; Each research department has a dedicated floor but here is also other reference materials and administrative floors.&nbsp; The ground level has a large door leading to a long hall.&nbsp; On either side are several doors to small lecture rooms or single studies for personal use.&nbsp; At the end of the hall is Janet's desk, in the open.&nbsp; To the right you'll see a stairway leading up and to the left a single door I've only been in once, when I was an applicant.&nbsp; It leads to a stairway heading down into where they conduct physical examinations.&nbsp; The very top floor before the roof is the residence of the Headmaster...I think.&nbsp; Each floor also has small residence for employees and researchers.&nbsp; Each department head has their own office.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Yesterday at 19:21</strong></p>
<p>Wait so does anybody have a home within the city or does every staff member live within UMAD?</p>
<p>Besides maybe people from our plane</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 19:23</strong></p>
<p>Some commute, many live in the city, but several live on site too.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Yesterday at 19:27</strong></p>
<p>Can we know which floors are which departments? It would really help us with planning these out, like where to move the quill and such.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 19:39</strong></p>
<p>First floor is the entrance and HR.&nbsp; Alchemy used to be on the sixth floor but there were complaints and it was moved to the second floor and is now separated from other research departments, Third is infernal affairs and accounting, Fourth is engineering,&nbsp; Fifth is Necromancy, sixth is culture, seventh is also culture due to their size, eighth is planar, ninth is aetherial studies, tenth is an administrative floor, eleventh is storage, everything above that doesn't really matter.&nbsp; There is structure beneath but I've only seen the physical examination room.</p>
<p>I should say there is also storage down below.&nbsp; Large item storage.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Yesterday at 19:42</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, this will definitely help :blush:</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 19:42</strong></p>
<p>Although there is talk of restructuring again in the future.&nbsp; Maybe a few months.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Yesterday at 19:43</strong></p>
<p>As I said before, we need to more about you. Now, you said you can't reveal too much, but there are a couple things we would like to know.</p>
<p>1. What Gender are you? We've been unsure what to refer to you as when discussing things, so what pronouns do you go by?</p>
<p>2. What is you goal with all this? At this point, we're assured UMAD is an issue, but we need to know what your part to play in all this is. Why do you want to investigate all this?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 19:43</strong></p>
<p>Diversifying the departments more.&nbsp; Maybe breaking culture into new departments and reopening religious studies.&nbsp; Nothing to worry about now.&nbsp; It's also just talk at mess.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Yesterday at 19:43</strong></p>
<p>We'll get to that when the time comes. For now I vote the quill either engineering or culture.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Yesterday at 19:44</strong></p>
<p>Why those two Snow?</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Yesterday at 19:45</strong></p>
<p>Both are relatively close to Janet's desk and has low risks due to security. We haven't had anything from engineering so maybe we could find something random that could be helpful or culture to know more about the researchers while the information flow is still heightened.</p>

<p>It seems pretty compartmentalized though. I’m not sure we’d gain much from Culture at this stage. On the other hand, I don’t know enough about engineering to make a call. So what do the rest of y’all think?</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Yesterday at 19:49</strong></p>
<p>i agree with snow</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Yesterday at 19:49</strong></p>
<p>I don't know what we could learn from engineering either. Nor Aetherial Studies.</p>
<p>And also, Peach, did Kemist ever reach out to you?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 19:56</strong></p>
<p>The latter should go much without saying but I'll give you the narrative.&nbsp; The UMAD originated years ago after the Ramean Revolution.&nbsp; The revolutionaries won and Rameus' policies created a complete overhaul of the current legal system, the removal of nobility as we understood it, and land reform.&nbsp; The acquisition of land where Dial is presently came with the aggressive removal of the local goblinoids.&nbsp; Samuel was a specialist during the war and used the movement of information to influence relationships with undesirables to assist in the unilateral warfare conducted.&nbsp; Once the land was acquired Ramean policy stated that the government be separated into three separate powers and Rameus limited his own authority.&nbsp; Maybe a little too much was given to intelligence.&nbsp; Intelligence controls much of the national defense budget, military, education now that it is accessible, and public information campaigns. &nbsp; UMAD is an entirely secular entity who considers the religious ideologies and needs within the world but does not conduct action in accordance with the benefit of any faith.&nbsp; As they deemed research necessary they would push legislation through means of aggressive political tactics in court.&nbsp; They may not write the laws but they often control public image of those representing.&nbsp; This has eased up restrictions to allow for more efficient experimentation and research sometimes at the expense of simple citizens.&nbsp; Their methods, while efficient, seem extreme to me.&nbsp; What made me start my work was when the headmaster released an organization policy update and new verbiage for the rules and regulations handbook.&nbsp; It no longer reads in the benefit of Belthas but in the benefit of the material plane.&nbsp; The Headmaster's decision I saw as a meaningful and concerning prospective, my collogues think I'm being over dramatic, reading into it too much.</p>
<p>Yes but Kemist never responded to me.</p>
<p>As for the former question, we have a saying in UMAD.&nbsp; Need to Know.&nbsp; I don't think my gender is relevant.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Yesterday at 20:04</strong></p>
<p>That is honestly quite fair. There are people on our plane who prefer to be guarded about such things as well. Rest assured you’re not obligated to answer if you don’t wish to</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Yesterday at 20:05</strong></p>
<p>We just wanted to check.</p>
<p>Anyway, since Kemist never responded, we're looking at other Candidates for our last spot, but we need to check if they're not involved in anyway.</p>
<p>Did TylerGuy come up in any of the reports we got as being involved?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 20:08</strong></p>
<p>Not that I know of.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Yesterday at 20:08</strong></p>
<p>Ok, I'm gonna contact them and see if their Interested. Since you're now here, I'll go ahead and test them myself, since I know how to do it.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 20:09</strong></p>
<p>So you're looking for one or two more people?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Yesterday at 20:10</strong></p>
<p>Just one more. Gruffles is still on Honeymoon, but they should be back in time, so we only need one more.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Yesterday at 20:16</strong></p>
<p>So the started up on human testing and now you want to find what's actually going on. Which is understandable. What information would be possibly useful if we were to move the quill to engineering or aetherial studies?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 20:19</strong></p>
<p>Other people's involvement for one.&nbsp; We might be able to get information on why the engineering department has no head should we go there.&nbsp; Alchemy seems mostly irrelevant but they are still involved in the project somehow.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Yesterday at 20:20</strong></p>
<p>Ok, Tylerguy passed the test. Bringing them in.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Yesterday at 20:21</strong></p>
<p>Welcome to the PITS!</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Yesterday at 20:21</strong></p>
<p>Than engineering sounds like a good idea</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Yesterday at 20:21</strong></p>
<p>Hello o/</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Yesterday at 20:21</strong></p>
<p>And that was quick Shades! Dang</p>
<p>Welcome</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Yesterday at 20:21</strong></p>
<p>Is Alchemy still super risky from the rats escaping?</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Yesterday at 20:22</strong></p>
<p>I already knew what the message was before I read the hint</p>
<p>Happy to be here, hope I can be of some help to you all</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Yesterday at 20:23</strong></p>
<p>If that decipher speed was anything to say, you will be a great addition lol</p>
<p>Welcome to the team!</p>
<p>I'm still new to learning how to decipher stuff but I'm super good at making connections</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 20:28</strong></p>
<p>It's very secure for the rats.</p>
<p>If anything the rats made things less secure everywhere but the lab they are stored in.</p>
<p>There is a storm, this might effect my connection.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Yesterday at 20:33</strong></p>
<p>Okay then Alchemy would be good if only that one section is on alert. I thought the whole floor was</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 20:36</strong></p>
<p>Many floors are upset by Alchemy's lack of security with the rats but that is all.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Yesterday at 20:40</strong></p>
<p>Then if that's the case, my vote is to move the quill to Alchemy.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Yesterday at 20:44</strong></p>
<p>I'm not so sure. We need to go where we know we can learn something. Right now, alchemy is a crapshoot. We may not find anything there, and we can't afford to chase a red herring right now.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Yesterday at 20:45</strong></p>
<p>I thought Alchemy was having a heavy hand the upcoming test? If we could learn even a smidge more information before then it would be benificial.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Yesterday at 20:46</strong></p>
<p>Can you verify that, Peach? Is alchemy involved at all in the next test?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 20:47</strong></p>
<p>Alchemy is but I'm not certain to what capacity.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Yesterday at 20:48</strong></p>
<p>Ok, the I do think it's worth looking into after all. I agree with checking alchemy</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 20:52</strong></p>
<p>Does anyone have a problem with that?</p>
<p>It'll be rather fast for me.&nbsp; I can do it while I go grab Orzo.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Yesterday at 20:54</strong></p>
<p>@here any objections to moving the quill to alchemy, speak now.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Yesterday at 20:54</strong></p>
<p>I agree</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Yesterday at 20:56</strong></p>
<p>I agree</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Yesterday at 20:59</strong></p>
<p>Agree</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Yesterday at 21:03</strong></p>
<p>I’m actually still of the mind Engineering would be better but majority rules</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 21:26</strong></p>
<p>Grabbed Orzo but I can move the quill now if everyone is good.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Yesterday at 21:26</strong></p>
<p>We have a Majority vote at this point, so let's move it Alchemy</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 21:26</strong></p>
<p>Sounds good, Will do</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Yesterday at 21:28</strong></p>
<p>If you do find any notes from where we left it, be sure to fill us in. It's been there for a while, if I recall</p>
<h2>12th August 2021</h2>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 17:17</strong></p>
<p>Peach, just to let you know, we nearly had a Leak. We had to bring Kemist in, cause they Blabbed about your DM since they needed help solving it. We got them to delete the Post, but Argent did see it, so we're not sure how bad this ended up being.</p>
<p><strong>Kemist stonks — Today at 17:24</strong></p>
<p>I think i may have compromised the entire mission-</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 17:24</strong></p>
<p>We'll see what the Damage is soon. But for now. All we can do is keep at it and see what happens.</p>
<p><strong>Kemist stonks — Today at 17:24</strong></p>
<p>I think i may have compromised the entire mission-</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 17:24</strong></p>
<p>We'll see what the Damage is soon. But for now. All we can do is keep at it and see what happens.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 17:34</strong></p>
<p>@Peach Might want to get on soon and see the recent posts.</p>
<p><span class="text-big"><mark class="pen-red"><strong>[Peach leaves the Project Grindstone server]</strong></mark></span></p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:32</strong></p>
<p>I've left the server.&nbsp; There definitely was a leak.&nbsp; I'm pretty sure they know I'm not alone now too.&nbsp; I'm sure they suspected me but a public leak means they will be more aggressive to save face as well.&nbsp; I can no longer be on the server.&nbsp; This means their security will be heightened which will restrict my movement some and I'm sure a the manhunt will begin to implicate others.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:33</strong></p>
<p>Crap... This is bad</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 20:33</strong></p>
<p>Yes it is</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 20:33</strong></p>
<p>surely they'll be suspious you left the server tho?</p>
<p><strong>Kemist stonks — Today at 20:34</strong></p>
<p>Welp</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:34</strong></p>
<p>The name peach was used and Necromancy isn't incompetent.&nbsp; I assumed they might have suspected me earlier but weren't certain if others were implicated yet.&nbsp; Now they definitely are.</p>
<p><strong>Kemist stonks — Today at 20:35</strong></p>
<p>ive fucked up then-</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 20:35</strong></p>
<p>Do they know you directly? Like your connection to the name Peach?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:35</strong></p>
<p>They'll likely question Kemist first, since he blabbed</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 20:35</strong></p>
<p>Are they hunting us now then?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:36</strong></p>
<p>You've only fucked up if we can't use this to our advantage somehow.&nbsp; I think we should think of how to turn this around and benefit from it.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 20:36</strong></p>
<p>I guess now they'll be scurrying</p>
<p><strong>Kemist stonks — Today at 20:36</strong></p>
<p>hmm</p>
<p>we could give them false info to change their perspective?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:37</strong></p>
<p>I might have another idea. They're after me anyway, so make me a scapegoat</p>
<p>I'll say I dug in and found info they were after me, and that I made the peach account to find others to dig deeper</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:38</strong></p>
<p>Their investigation will limit my movement but their activity will mean that our actions are more public.&nbsp; We could use this for evidentiary support for gaining more allies after future recruitment rounds.</p>
<p>What if instead you used this opprotunity to gain trust?</p>
<p><strong>Kemist stonks — Today at 20:39</strong></p>
<p>like giving info to gain allies or do you mean something else?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:39</strong></p>
<p>How?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:39</strong></p>
<p>Say you found Peach but don't know who they are yet.&nbsp; Try to be a mole.</p>
<p><strong>Kemist stonks — Today at 20:39</strong></p>
<p>ah ok</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:40</strong></p>
<p>A double-agent.</p>
<p><strong>Kemist stonks — Today at 20:40</strong></p>
<p>big brain-</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:40</strong></p>
<p>To be fair, we don't know much about you, so we wouldn't be lying. I can take that role</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 20:40</strong></p>
<p>Be aware this is a big gamble Shades. If you get discovered…</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:40</strong></p>
<p>It would be risky however. One wrong move and they could shut you out completely, or much worse.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:41</strong></p>
<p>Again, they're after me anyway, so I have the best chance</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 20:41</strong></p>
<p>Just try not to martyr yourself please</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:41</strong></p>
<p>Don't plan on it</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 20:41</strong></p>
<p>I'd say it would be better for Stonks to be the double agent though since they were the original one to say the leak</p>
<p>otherwise they could take out two of us rather than one</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:42</strong></p>
<p>It does little good to sacrifice unnecessarily.&nbsp; Be smart and keep safe with anything you do or say.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:42</strong></p>
<p>I'd advise against that, chuck. He's inexperienced and young. That could make him easily manipulated</p>
<p><strong>Kemist stonks — Today at 20:43</strong></p>
<p>Agreed</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:43</strong></p>
<p>No offense, kemist</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:43</strong></p>
<p>Are any of us really experienced in this?</p>
<p><strong>Kemist stonks — Today at 20:43</strong></p>
<p>non taken :D</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 20:43</strong></p>
<p>Heh no lol</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:43</strong></p>
<p>But we know Kemist is 14 years old. That age can make him a liability</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 20:43</strong></p>
<p>Should we end up needing to sacrifice someone…we’ll cross that bridge when we get there</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 20:43</strong></p>
<p>Well only if you're sure then, and keep us posted. Maybe add another channel so you can post what UMAD says to you?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:44</strong></p>
<p>I like that idea</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:44</strong></p>
<p>They will likely reach out to Kemist.&nbsp; They are no fools though.&nbsp; You'll need to keep playing it off as the communication when nowhere.&nbsp; Send evidence if you can once they reach out.&nbsp; They will also notice however that you deleted your message which will raise suspicion.&nbsp; They will look at time stamps, anything they can find on you, anything.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 20:45</strong></p>
<p>We will need to be wary then</p>
<p><strong>Kemist stonks — Today at 20:45</strong></p>
<p>idea we could make them think they got really valuable info when in reality its all just some&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:46</strong></p>
<p>Only issue is timestamps</p>
<p>Yeah</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 20:47</strong></p>
<p>What did you find from the quill?</p>
<p><strong>Kemist stonks — Today at 20:47</strong></p>
<p>i could just seem like im working alone but in reality its an inside mission?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:47</strong></p>
<p>Nah, they won't buy that</p>
<p>You name-dropped peach, so they know you're not alone</p>
<p><strong>Kemist stonks — Today at 20:48</strong></p>
<p>oh dam your right</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 20:48</strong></p>
<p>they don't know if you have any connection to us besides looking into mutual friends, which they might already have done</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:48</strong></p>
<p>They can only do that if they friended all of us</p>
<p><strong>Kemist stonks — Today at 20:49</strong></p>
<p>hmm lemme unfriend you just incase</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:49</strong></p>
<p>Good idea</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 20:49</strong></p>
<p>They can’t look at mutual friend unless we’re friends with them. Did you friend any of the staff?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:49</strong></p>
<p>Nope</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 20:49</strong></p>
<p>Then we should be good!</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:50</strong></p>
<p>I'll say this once, they have the ability to offer you quite a bit but what they offer will determine the value of finding me to them.&nbsp; As long as they think there is not a net loss it will be in their ability to do so.&nbsp; This can help us determine how serious the investigation is but also makes you a real risk in the future.&nbsp; Being a double agent means we should all agree that you are up to it and won't turn sides part way through this war.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:51</strong></p>
<p>I don't like being a target for experimentation, so I'm not up for joining them</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 20:51</strong></p>
<p>I mean, I could probably give the double agent thing a shot. I'm all for this team.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 20:51</strong></p>
<p>No Snow. You’ve been pretty active and helpful. The team needs you</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 20:51</strong></p>
<p>I could also, UMAD already sees me as a bit of a golden boy</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 20:52</strong></p>
<p>^^^</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:52</strong></p>
<p>Chuck might be a good call as well. He's not so easily swayed either</p>
<p><strong>Kemist stonks — Today at 20:52</strong></p>
<p>i would but i am a child so my i may be manipulated but idk</p>
<p>chuck seems like the best person who could do it</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 20:52</strong></p>
<p>Chuck is the fan favorite lol</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 20:53</strong></p>
<p>Lol</p>
<p><strong>Kemist stonks — Today at 20:53</strong></p>
<p>y e s</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:53</strong></p>
<p>There is no real way of determining character like this so I say whomever goes should have a majority vote.&nbsp; There are twelve of you.&nbsp; I will also say that whoever goes should recieve all of our support in this.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 20:53</strong></p>
<p>I'll need a bit of help to compose a message to UMAD but I think I could do it</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:54</strong></p>
<p>I may have become the De Facto leader of this little team, but a good leader knows who's best for the job. I vote Chuck</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 20:54</strong></p>
<p>I also vote chuck</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 20:54</strong></p>
<p>I have faith that Chuck's got this</p>

<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:55</strong></p>

<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:55</strong></p>
<p>Even one?</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Today at 20:55</strong></p>
<p>i'm conflicted</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 20:55</strong></p>
<p>1 more person for majority</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 20:55</strong></p>
<p>It's understandable</p>
<p>The only other person I could think of is me. UMAD thinks I'm a lone party</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Today at 20:57</strong></p>
<p>but the leak has already established that the person taking the fall + becoming the double agent doesnt work alone</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:57</strong></p>
<p>Even with a decision I think you should be very certain of your decision.&nbsp; I've got some hand made constructs out of reject parts.&nbsp; They are a well funded government organization</p>
<p>.</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Today at 20:57</strong></p>
<p>shades is already on the radar, so this could be a good way to keep the attention focused on him and away from anyone else on our team</p>
<p>it could also change UMAD's mind about him, because from what I hear they don't hold him in high regards right now</p>
<p><strong>Kemist stonks — Today at 20:57</strong></p>
<p>i n t e r e s t i n g</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 20:57</strong></p>
<p>What would we need the construct for Peach?</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 20:58</strong></p>
<p>UMAD is already watching me, they've told me. This could keep Shades safe</p>
<p>At least for a bit longer</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 20:58</strong></p>
<p>personally, we need to keep the attention off shades right now</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Today at 20:58</strong></p>
<p>chuck is the golden boy, so that gives them the highest chance of success; this could, as chuck has just said, divert attention from shades, and make sure he's still also being considered for a position</p>
<p><strong>Kemist stonks — Today at 20:58</strong></p>
<p>Yea</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 20:59</strong></p>
<p>So you're voting for Chuck?</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Today at 20:59</strong></p>
<p>with all of these things considered, i'll have to pick the safer option</p>
<p>yeah, chuck has my vote</p>
<p><strong>Kemist stonks — Today at 20:59</strong></p>
<p>ayy</p>
<p>#chuckparty</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 21:00</strong></p>
<p>ok, so we have a majority for chuck</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Today at 21:00</strong></p>
<p>we can't risk shades at this point, and chuck is in a pretty safe spot rn</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 21:00</strong></p>
<p>Ok cool</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 21:00</strong></p>
<p>Very well, if you're certain.&nbsp; Just be prepared for whatever comes Chuck.&nbsp; I need to go but when I get back we can talk about the quill notes.</p>
<p><strong>Kemist stonks — Today at 21:00</strong></p>
<p>Bai</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Today at 21:01</strong></p>
<p>Alright</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 21:01</strong></p>
<p>Good luck with the meeting</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 21:01</strong></p>
<p>Right then @TheShades I'll need a channel to post what UMAD says to me</p>
<p><strong>Kemist stonks — Today at 21:01</strong></p>
<p>Gl</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Today at 21:01</strong></p>
<p>take care!!</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 21:01</strong></p>
<p>Good luck Peach</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Today at 21:01</strong></p>
<p>we need to discuss your approach to this in more detail</p>
<p><strong>Kemist stonks — Today at 21:01</strong></p>
<p>hope you have a good meeting</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 21:01</strong></p>
<p>I'll set it up when I get home</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Today at 21:01</strong></p>
<p>what story we're giving UMAD and how, I mean</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 21:01</strong></p>
<p>Yeah definitely</p>
<p>For that it might be best to wait until Peach comes back before we finalise anything, Peach was mentioned in the leak so I don't want to put them in danger</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Today at 21:03</strong></p>
<p>Yeah</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 21:03</strong></p>
<p>Looks like we’re in agreement then</p>
<p>What is it Peach said…ah yes. May your walls be salted and your floors damp. I think</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 21:04</strong></p>
<p>Im good with chuck as well as shades</p>
<p><strong>Eris — Today at 21:10</strong></p>
<p>I’m a bit late but I support Chuck :sweat_smile:</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 21:16</strong></p>
<p>I just Realized: We need to Delete the Peach Channel in the Grindstone Server. They could easily find that, and expose us.</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 21:17</strong></p>
<p>they probably already know about that right?</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 21:17</strong></p>
<p>Well Rashos and Derpa do but not UMAD</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 21:18</strong></p>
<p>Not sure, but the sooner we get rid of it, the better.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 21:18</strong></p>
<p>How do you propose we delete an entire channel in a server we don’t own?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 21:19</strong></p>
<p>I'm not sure, but something needs to be done. That channel is wide out in the open for them to find, and there's a TON of stuff they could use to hang most of us here with</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 21:20</strong></p>
<p>https://tenor.com/view/phoenix-wright-ace-attorney-sweating-reaction-sweat-gif-18802913</p>
<p>Tenor</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 21:20</strong></p>
<p>assuming they couldn't see the channel before, what makes you think they can see the channel now?</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 21:21</strong></p>
<p>…That’s true</p>
<p>Peach had to add us before remember?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 21:21</strong></p>
<p>It's in their server. Odds are good they could find it eventually. It's only a matter of time</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 21:21</strong></p>
<p>We have the transcript, we could just delete what we ourselves said</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 21:21</strong></p>
<p>especially since they now know what to look for.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 21:21</strong></p>
<p>With Peach gone, it would be impossible to find it</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 21:21</strong></p>
<p>what the hell did i miss while i was asleep?</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 21:21</strong></p>
<p>with peach gone, noone can be added to that channel</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 21:21</strong></p>
<p>That would take a long time</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Today at 21:22</strong></p>
<p>if peach could add us to the channel, peach should also be able to erase the channel, right?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 21:22</strong></p>
<p>We had a Leak, and now shit has hit the fan</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Today at 21:22</strong></p>
<p>oh right, peach has left</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 21:22</strong></p>
<p>they left that discord</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 21:22</strong></p>
<p>oh fuck me</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 21:23</strong></p>
<p>Hey Peach could you get Rashos or Derpa to delete the channel we were all on? We have a back up of everything said, so it's safe to get rid of it.</p>
<p>And now that you're on this channel, that one is irrelevant.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 23:01</strong></p>
<p>I could see if I can collapse any traces of involvement there.</p>
<p><strong>Kemist stonks — Today at 23:01</strong></p>
<p>your back :0</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 23:01</strong></p>
<p>Welcome back and oh I hope so</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 23:02</strong></p>
<p>The Sooner the better. If they somehow find that Channel, all of us are screwed.</p>
<p><strong>Kemist stonks — Today at 23:02</strong></p>
<p>well all except the newly joined ones but yea</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 23:03</strong></p>
<p>With as many of us as they would catch, the ones left would be left aimless and it would fall like a house of cards at that point</p>
<p><strong>Kemist stonks — Today at 23:05</strong></p>
<p>dam thats philosophical-</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 23:06</strong></p>
<p>Quill news, the next stage of recruitment starts within two of your hours.</p>
<p>Has everyone been caught up on everything discussed so far?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 23:07</strong></p>
<p>For the most part. Though this could be bad timing for me. A Storm is hitting here and there's a chance I lose power soon.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 23:07</strong></p>
<p>So far so good</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 23:07</strong></p>
<p>A number of the researchers are getting involved now that weren't before.&nbsp; For one, Hanford is.&nbsp; She is a member of Alchemy but I have personally never seen her.</p>
<p><strong>Kemist stonks — Today at 23:10</strong></p>
<p>i n t e r e s t i n g</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 23:10</strong></p>
<p>Alchemy seems to be investigating, with the support of culture, cognition and perception.&nbsp; A lot of notes here on altered states of conciousness.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 23:11</strong></p>
<p>So like a sleeper agent?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 23:11</strong></p>
<p>So they're making some kind of Drug to get people "High" as we call it.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 23:12</strong></p>
<p>More like they are developing compounds to further understand what external influences influence certain responses.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 23:13</strong></p>
<p>Maybe seeking something to control or manipulate people through external stimuli</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 23:13</strong></p>
<p>This might not be at all relevant to the project but it does raise concerns.&nbsp; Not yet have I found anything that the interdepartmental project suggests the need for this.</p>
<p><strong>Kemist stonks — Today at 23:13</strong></p>
<p>is this substance one that makes the user feel as though they are in a higher consciousness?</p>
<p>or is it not a substance at all?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 23:14</strong></p>
<p>Varying sensory inhibitions to find how select media and sensory data effects pleasure and attention.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 23:15</strong></p>
<p>Get us Happy and Complacent, it seems</p>
<p><strong>Kemist stonks — Today at 23:15</strong></p>
<p>so it’s a form of self reward?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 23:15</strong></p>
<p>And to Focus on whatever task they give us for maximum efficiency</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 23:16</strong></p>
<p>so the matrix.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 23:16</strong></p>
<p>They're using videos and media and such and putting in waves to make us complacent. Lovely.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 23:16</strong></p>
<p>In a sense, but not the exact same</p>
<p><strong>Kemist stonks — Today at 23:16</strong></p>
<p>hmm it sounds more of sensory deprivation..</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 23:19</strong></p>
<p>Arousal, valence, and attention come up often.</p>
<p>They find positive valence does not necessarily produce increased attention but heightened arousal almost always does.</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 23:20</strong></p>
<p>oh my</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 23:21</strong></p>
<p>Odd, in our world, Arousal often decreases attention, since we're then focused on deal with said arousal</p>
<p><strong>Kemist stonks — Today at 23:21</strong></p>
<p>so what your saying is they’ve made a high tech vibrator?-</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 23:21</strong></p>
<p>Fear is almost as effective as joy for instance.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 23:21</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, but Fear has Drawbacks. Joy is easier to work with</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 23:21</strong></p>
<p>Not that kind of arousal I'm pretty certain…</p>
<p><strong>Kemist stonks — Today at 23:21</strong></p>
<p>got it..</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 23:21</strong></p>
<p>There is a sense of entertainment when it comes to horror and fear</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 23:22</strong></p>
<p>My conclusion is they want to find a way to maximize attention.&nbsp; Perhaps it's for retention?</p>
<p><strong>Kemist stonks — Today at 23:22</strong></p>
<p>our human emotions have been number since we’ve almost dominated this world so we make our senses feel artificially</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 23:23</strong></p>
<p>Again, likely Efficiency. That is one thing they strive for, so keeping us focused on a task would be right up their alley</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 23:23</strong></p>
<p>Second phase of recruitment? As in they’re bringing in more people or another test incoming?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 23:24</strong></p>
<p>With every new puzzle, more and more people are hearing about this. If the right people spread the word, this could blow up big, giving UMAD all the test Subjects they need</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 23:24</strong></p>
<p>It looks like more people followed by a second stage of the second mission.&nbsp; I'm not certain when this second stage will begin.</p>
<p>How very Culture…</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 23:24</strong></p>
<p>Considering the researchers involved, it's no suprise</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 23:25</strong></p>
<p>Hmm. There's a lot of big names in this so them using their platforms to get more recruits is probably going to be another step. Maybe a collab.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 23:25</strong></p>
<p>So what we do know is they are interested in attention, will, and conciousness while also being multi-planar and utilizing multiple entertainers from your world.&nbsp; Also they want lots of subjects.</p>
<p><strong>Kemist stonks — Today at 23:26</strong></p>
<p>interesting by subjects do you mean people/followers?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 23:26</strong></p>
<p>I'm not gonna lie, this sounds like bad news. They might be trying to find something to basically control the human population through complacency, and put us to work for their purposes</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 23:27</strong></p>
<p>I do know Researcher Hyles and Researcher March were discussing combining their efforts for the application process but I assumed this was more of the same.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 23:27</strong></p>
<p>I have a horrible feeling this might be something to do with that experiment they tend to involve Shades in</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 23:27</strong></p>
<p>That likely means they'll be doing a broadcast together to promote the project. Seems the most likely plan</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 23:31</strong></p>
<p>I do know whatever the two are doing it'll be sometime soon.&nbsp; Although that is a very vague estimate.</p>
<p>Should I keep the quill where it is or move it?</p>
<p><strong>Kemist stonks — Today at 23:36</strong></p>
<p>Engineering</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 23:36</strong></p>
<p>I say engineering.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 23:36</strong></p>
<p>I agree</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 23:36</strong></p>
<p>We're thinking Engineering, given we've learned everything we can about the test. Time to see what they're up to over there.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 23:37</strong></p>
<p>We don't know anything from there and new info would be great.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 23:38</strong></p>
<p>Do we want to round it off after with aetherial studies?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 23:38</strong></p>
<p>Sounds like a Plan to me!</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 23:38</strong></p>
<p>That would be good</p>
<p><strong>Kemist stonks — Today at 23:38</strong></p>
<p>y e s</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 23:42</strong></p>
<p>Id almost suggest necromancy but after the leak im sure their security is back on high alert. Im good with engineering. Seeing more on meer soot is interesting</p>

<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 01:12</strong></p>
<p>peach are you sure this is right</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:13</strong></p>
<p>?</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 01:13</strong></p>
<p>it's been 2 hours</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 01:13</strong></p>
<p>No E-Mail from them yet</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 01:13</strong></p>
<p>what he said</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 01:13</strong></p>
<p>your source might have been incorrect</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:13</strong></p>
<p>Hmmm....</p>
<p>Maybe it's not an email they had planned.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 01:14</strong></p>
<p>Then what are we looking out for?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:17</strong></p>
<p>All I know is that they were planning on continuing the recruitment process and that some researchers assisting with that.</p>
<p>and who knows... maybe plans have changed after recent developments.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 01:25</strong></p>
<p>Perhaps. We've checked any possible place they might have posted an update, but nothing's turning up, so maybe they held off due to the leak</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:26</strong></p>
<p>Possibly…</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:49</strong></p>
<p>Probably regrouping today</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 01:50</strong></p>
<p>Well Crap. I was actually looking forward to solving some puzzles today.</p>
<p>Wait, We think we know what it was. CO just tweeted about the Project, so it wasn't the second Mission they were starting, but the Second Recruitment</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:153px;"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/BUCOzo7gWFL0qGUP_-dhXJgZeAQbQ3gMZwpcHfbxG38nWaXd5BPyerw0W4pk1OFBI_f3ASDlU1C97-Gvf0GzBavAUjl-5aHyCUU_yQGCLSVZurrVNXfV-gIhbOjdL39ZKbssbtP7"></figure>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:57</strong></p>
<p>Looks like it.&nbsp; Any others helping with recruitment?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 01:58</strong></p>
<p>None that we can find. We've checked all the other known researchers and staff (Lizzie, Hyles, SC, Janet, and March), but none of them are posting about it</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 01:59</strong></p>
<p>Caleb did it not that long ago so I doubt he’d do it again this soon</p>
<p>He’s not the type to drive something that hard</p>
<p>Can’t speak for the rest</p>
<p>Cami is probably keeping quiet so as to not reveal her involvement just yet</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 02:31</strong></p>
<p>So, I found another one. I opted to look through other discord members' twitters if they had it posted. Only the online ones atm, cause thats a fair number of names to comb through but anyways.</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:191px;"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Cp0eGATJ8tb1EeUreBg4Fv37gkpDECKW9KmDUFBRX0ZWzob5lEPVwcYm0AF5VY_73nJ3ZyEW4Wk2IL2Z6XVuyEL0Mz-PCOyN_OznibW6pDu4TiE3hX1fpTYIygPFbrTwHDe0DkOo"></figure>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 02:31</strong></p>
<p>Another name I don't recognize</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:31</strong></p>
<p>So they are part of this. Wonder which of the names they are.</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 02:32</strong></p>
<p>What were the names we still wanted to figure out?</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 02:33</strong></p>
<p>Hanford, Mann, and Khan</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 02:33</strong></p>
<p>Well thats Laidlaw. May not be one of those 3</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 02:33</strong></p>
<p>Unless he's operating under an alias</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 02:34</strong></p>
<p>Possibly</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Yesterday at 19:52</strong></p>
<p>I wonder what the situation over at UMAD is. Think they found anything?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Yesterday at 19:53</strong></p>
<p>We'll only know if Peach tells us what's going on, though they need to lay low, to avoid suspicion</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Yesterday at 19:55</strong></p>
<p>I know. But I am a little worried. Peach has been pretty quiet lately. Of course for all I know, they need to set up new elementals or whatever means they use to communicate with us</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Yesterday at 19:56</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, with everything on High Alert, They'll have to make adjustments to avoid getting spotted. We just have to trust they're doing fine. Not much we can do to help from here</p>
<h2>14th August 2021</h2>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:29</strong></p>
<p>I'm here</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 00:29</strong></p>
<p>Just in Time, Hyles says he's gonna share something soon. Might be related, but we'll find out soon</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:29</strong></p>
<p>Sudden inspection today of my department</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 00:30</strong></p>
<p>oh damn. Those are never fun.</p>
<p>Probably because of yesterday</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:30</strong></p>
<p>Maybe, I started spying on Researcher discords</p>
<p>Anna just made an announcement</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 00:30</strong></p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:31</strong></p>
<p>Yes</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 00:31</strong></p>
<p>Anything relevant?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:31</strong></p>
<p>Recruitment by the looks of it</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 00:32</strong></p>
<p>So more the same. Guess some Recruited by Twitter, and others by Discord</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:32</strong></p>
<p>Others by something called YT soon</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 00:32</strong></p>
<p>That might be what Hyles is up to</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 00:32</strong></p>
<p>They are really pushing recruitment it seems</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:33</strong></p>
<p>They apparently are using YT for recruitment and future missions.&nbsp; I'm not certain who is using it but UMAD definitely wants to implicate whatever it is.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 00:33</strong></p>
<p>YT = Youtube, the Same place I host my Videos</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:33</strong></p>
<p>Ah, I see.&nbsp; That makes sense.</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 00:33</strong></p>
<p>Might involve another clue for us to find as well</p>
<p>We have 1 minute til he streams</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 00:34</strong></p>
<p>You got a Link, Tyler?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:35</strong></p>
<p>Apparently Logan Laidlaw announced involvement through the stream</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 00:35</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://youtube.com/c/CalebHyles"><u>https://youtube.com/c/CalebHyles</u></a></p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 00:35</strong></p>
<p>Ok, so he doesn't have a Live Page yet</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 00:35</strong></p>
<p>He said to keep an eye on the YouTube</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 00:35</strong></p>
<p>I know that, and I already follow him.</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 00:35</strong></p>
<p>Not sure if he might also be going live on twitch</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 00:36</strong></p>
<p>We were discussing that earlier. He's another Voice Actor, so he might be another Researcher.</p>
<p>He's also BlazingAzureCrow on the main Server</p>
<p>Hyles is Live: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUoXZBa38Dw"><u>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUoXZBa38Dw</u></a></p>

<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 00:40</strong></p>
<p>Its started</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 00:40</strong></p>
<p>The Title mentions a New Cover Album, so making covers of other songs. But we'll keep an eye out for more</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 00:41</strong></p>
<p>Was about to mention that</p>
<p>Does Caleb usually announce streams tho?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 00:42</strong></p>
<p>He does tweet when he goes live, so hard to say if this is any different</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 00:42</strong></p>
<p>watching now</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 00:43</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/CalebHyles/status/1426327928699244547?s=19"><u>https://twitter.com/CalebHyles/status/1426327928699244547?s=19</u></a> might just be a music premier</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 00:43</strong></p>
<p>Still might mention something in passing. Besides, new Music is good enough reason to listen in</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 00:57</strong></p>
<p>Looks like Janet (Cami) is in the Chat as well.</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 00:58</strong></p>
<p>:eyes:</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:58</strong></p>
<p>Looks like the Anna Discord is exploding.&nbsp; This is a big victory for UMAD.</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 00:59</strong></p>
<p>What's happening in Anna's discord exactly?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:00</strong></p>
<p>She seems to have invited them to the project</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 01:00</strong></p>
<p>So her whole discord now has access to the project…</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 01:00</strong></p>
<p>Let me check. Her discord is open for all</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:00</strong></p>
<p>They linked The Shade's report on reddit</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 01:01</strong></p>
<p>What?</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 01:01</strong></p>
<p>They're using shades post to bring people in?</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 01:01</strong></p>
<p>but why?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:01</strong></p>
<p>UMAD just requested a general staffing call to action.&nbsp; Something is happening here.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 01:01</strong></p>
<p>Wow! Now I have my In</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 01:02</strong></p>
<p>somethings up?</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 01:02</strong></p>
<p>Something is definitely happening here</p>
<p>Shades seems to be in the middle of it</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 01:02</strong></p>
<p>i got a bad felling about this</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 01:03</strong></p>
<p>Well let's see where this leads. Best I keep an eye out for now</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 01:03</strong></p>
<p>Agreed</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:05</strong></p>
<p>I thought I might be safe for awhile here since there are so many people but eventually I will need to leave.</p>
<p>by here I mean her discord</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 01:05</strong></p>
<p>then go</p>

<p>Its probably best for you not to be seen anywhere, especially since your department was under investigation</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:15</strong></p>
<p>Checked engineering messages</p>
<p>A lot to go through but right now know that they are planning an email tonight</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 01:15</strong></p>
<p>Yes, please indulge</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:15</strong></p>
<p>They are opening the flood gates soon to the discord</p>
<p>They also plan to do this more than once.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 01:16</strong></p>
<p>CRAP! I'm gonna be busy tonight! Why does keep happening; every time I'm busy, that's when things happen</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:16</strong></p>
<p>probably coincidence...&nbsp; maybe on purpose?</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 01:17</strong></p>
<p>UMAD can now mind read</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 01:17</strong></p>
<p>How would they know my Schedule? Are the Stalking me or something</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 01:18</strong></p>
<p>Wouldn't surprise me</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 01:19</strong></p>
<p>Seems Anna's Discord is struggling with the first Mission, lol</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:20</strong></p>
<p>I'd let it go</p>
<p>Too many successes and you'll be looking at competition for their good graces later</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 01:20</strong></p>
<p>Any lead we can get on the rest is probably a good thing</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:21</strong></p>
<p>I'm sorting through these messages as fast as possible.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 01:21</strong></p>
<p>They're gonna keep trying to recruit regardless, so they may help their own to get there. Not really gonna make a difference. our crew can solve much faster than these guys. Plus, me taking initiative might help keep me in said good graces as well</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:23</strong></p>
<p>good point</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 01:23</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/annapantsu/status/1426332481712754689?s=19"><u>https://twitter.com/annapantsu/status/1426332481712754689?s=19</u></a> Anna tweeted about it</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 01:23</strong></p>
<p>Now the rest of us needs to look good lol</p>
<p>Besides Chuck and Tyler. The processing speed on those two</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 01:26</strong></p>
<p>They seem to be at the Polybius square stage now</p>
<p>Don't think it'll be long before they figure it out</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 01:28</strong></p>
<p>Not so sure. They can't even get past the Polybius Cipher, and they still need to find it's a Viginere Cipher afterwards</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:29</strong></p>
<p>With as many people as there is it'll only be a matter of time</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 01:30</strong></p>
<p>But it does mean we still have the edge. With some of the people we have here, we'll have it figured out long before they do. I'm not worried.</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 01:30</strong></p>
<p>Everyone still has Access to the second objective, even if they haven't solved the first</p>
<p>But we still have the edge of knowing what to look for</p>
<p>And the 2 letters we've already found</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:31</strong></p>
<p>Engineering and aetherial studies worked to create the current instruments UMAD is using to look into your world.&nbsp; They have been in contact with a number of people for well over a year now while others for a much shorter time.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 01:32</strong></p>
<p>Makes Sense. They would need time to set all this up and to get people to help on this end</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 01:33</strong></p>
<p>Ok, so they don't yet know what the 3rd stage is</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 01:33</strong></p>
<p>They're getting close, though</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 01:34</strong></p>
<p>There's some smart people in this discord</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 01:38</strong></p>
<p>i'm going to be up till 7 in the morning so i'm good</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 01:38</strong></p>
<p>Bowser and Ghostconsultant are two to watch, I'd say</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 01:38</strong></p>
<p>Yeah</p>
<p>Is ghost trying to bruteforce it?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 01:41</strong></p>
<p>YEah, but Bowser got it</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 01:43</strong></p>
<p>Bowser is definitely one to watch</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 01:44</strong></p>
<p>Indeed</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 01:46</strong></p>
<p>Mail</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 01:46</strong></p>
<p>Bowser is now in the main discord</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 01:46</strong></p>
<p>E-mail</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 01:46</strong></p>
<p>Looks like it just welcoming the new guys</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 01:46</strong></p>
<p>K</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 01:53</strong></p>
<p>Was there anything else from the engineering reports?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:03</strong></p>
<p>Oh lord. Anna's discord is flooding the main Server. She has over 1100 People in her's, so that main server is gonna be a mess from here on out. We might just have the edge here.</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 02:04</strong></p>
<p>Indeed</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:07</strong></p>
<p>Sorry, back</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 02:07</strong></p>
<p>welcome back</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 02:07</strong></p>
<p>Hope everything's fine</p>
<p>How was the general staff meeting?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:09</strong></p>
<p>They are discussing possibly repeating this recruitment technique with Caleb in the future but there is no confirmation.&nbsp; I've also confirmed through both Alchemy and Engineering that Hanford has a different alias in your world.&nbsp; There is also no intention to replace the head of engineering.&nbsp; The position is open and there have been several applications but the Assistant Headmaster has not decided on anyone at this time.</p>
<p>I didn't go to the general staffing meeting or at least all of it.&nbsp; Anyone who is within the research teams only has to voluntarily.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:11</strong></p>
<p>Ok, so we need to figure out Hanford's Alias. If only we had any clues where to look.</p>
<p>Like what they might be known for here. That might point me in the right direction</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:17</strong></p>
<p>All I know is they are also in the discord at this time.</p>
<p><strong>ZellaSwiffham — Today at 02:18</strong></p>
<p>im up, so whats this new email about</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:18</strong></p>
<p>With how many people just joined, that's gonna be tricky.</p>
<p>I wonder if that Logan Laidlaw fellow is him?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:19</strong></p>
<p>A Boatload of new people just showed up, so the e-mail was just welcoming them. Nothing new for us.</p>
<p><strong>ZellaSwiffham — Today at 02:19</strong></p>
<p>ahhhh okay i thought there wasnt much in it, thx</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:58</strong></p>
<p>UMAD just spoke in the main chat:</p>
<p><i>UMAD-MANAGEMENT — Today at 9:57 PM</i></p>
<p><i>All dimensions beyond fifth are illusions based on artifact data and ought not be observed.</i></p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 02:59</strong></p>
<p>saw that</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 03:00</strong></p>
<p>UMAD messaged me back</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 03:00</strong></p>
<p>what?</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 03:00</strong></p>
<p>I asked the in a DM if I could as k questions and they said yes but it could be need to know or limited.</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 03:01</strong></p>
<p>K</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 03:01</strong></p>
<p>I started with asking what doublelock was.</p>
<p>I need to keep some kind of front and ask things that the general chat would know. Is there any questions anyone can think of?</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 03:03</strong></p>
<p>What is Project Grindstone?</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 03:04</strong></p>
<p>I'll ask that next. I'm doing this one at a time</p>
<p>Need to know is what they said about project grindstone</p>
<p>They said the same about doublelock that Peach said</p>
<p>I asked about the different departments since I don't 'technically' know</p>
<p>Not within my clearence to know the departments they said. I asked what was within my clearence.</p>
<p>They said need to know. I asked if I could know anything about Janet, Bruce, or Pauchik. Surface data, you know?</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 03:16</strong></p>
<p>Uh the mysterious SC just said "A". Idk if that could be part of the solution to the second objective</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 03:23</strong></p>
<p>I don't know what else to ask without looking sus.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 03:23</strong></p>
<p>I'm asking for clues about the second objective</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 03:32</strong></p>
<p><i>Snow_Woman — Today at 9:30 PM</i></p>
<p><i>Can I submit multiple answers as long as one is correct?</i></p>

<p><i>UMAD-MANAGEMENT — Today at 9:32 PM</i></p>
<p><i>The applicant scorecard is private to admissions and will be released at the end of your application process.&nbsp; The score is an integer at minimum value 1 and maximum value 100.</i></p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 03:34</strong></p>
<p>Yeah...&nbsp; I scored an 88</p>
<p>your score used to be public but that's no longer the case.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 03:35</strong></p>
<p>I asked what was passing and they said need to know. What is passing and what do they grade on?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 03:35</strong></p>
<p>I think it was Culture's idea to breed competition at first.</p>
<p>No idea, I knew someone who had a 70 one year and got in.&nbsp; Another friend of mine was given employee status but couldn't make researcher track at 86 another year.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 03:36</strong></p>
<p>That's weird</p>
<p>Different scores but the higher score got lower clearence</p>
<p>So the number doesn't matter but the person?</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 03:37</strong></p>
<p>maybe it's not just the number they are testing us on</p>
<p>maybe there's other factors in play</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 03:38</strong></p>
<p>I could believe that.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 03:38</strong></p>
<p>Is there anything anyone can think of to ask them?</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 03:39</strong></p>
<p>maybe you ask whether it's just the score they're taking into account</p>
<p>maybe it might be a good idea to move the quill into culture, given all the stuff we've learnt today</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 03:43</strong></p>
<p>Do you think we should recruit more people or is 12 ample?&nbsp; I don't know how many of these people are actual applicants but there is so much going on in the annapantsu discord…</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 03:44</strong></p>
<p>we've got our eyes on some people, might be worth recruiting them before they become more of a competitor</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 03:46</strong></p>

<p><i>I see a lot of different pictures like a manor and mines and such and wanted to know if all the locations were based in Obelus City. That's the only full city map and the floating landmass(?) in it is used as the Project Grindstone icon on web tabs.</i></p>

<p>Engineering is discussing with necromancy the prospect of an "application".</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 03:55</strong></p>
<p>Interesting</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 03:55</strong></p>
<p>Ah fun.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 03:57</strong></p>
<p>The discord will be reorganized soon to prepare for new applicants.&nbsp; They are also preparing for future missions.&nbsp; It seems that Engineering has submitted lesson plans to Janet to help facilitate the construction of your final application mission.</p>
<p>March, Hyles, Janet, Laidlaw, and Hanford have confirmed their participation in mission three.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 03:58</strong></p>
<p>Hanford is the only one we haven't identified.</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 03:58</strong></p>
<p>We'd better get on that</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 03:58</strong></p>
<p>So far we knows she's female</p>
<p>And that Hanford is an alias</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:05</strong></p>
<p>all I could confirm is they were wished success on "A Dream" today.</p>

<p><strong>megaranger467 — Yesterday at 15:05</strong></p>
<p>good night</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Yesterday at 15:11</strong></p>
<p>We also brought in Emerys, who's Chuck's Boyfriend. The two of them should be a good help</p>

<p>Out of random curiosity, is cheese a delicacy in your world Peach?</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Yesterday at 22:20</strong></p>
<p>Hi Peach, whenever youre free could you elaborate on what UMAD have said about the Belthidian law and the Toristic processes of observation?</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Yesterday at 22:33</strong></p>
<p>peach is not in the main server</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Yesterday at 22:40</strong></p>
<p>they didnt elaborate anything in the main server but did repeately mention those two things, but we dont currently know what those things are</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 23:05</strong></p>
<p>There are so many messages.</p>
<h2>15th August 2021</h2>

<p>Hello all</p>
<p>Janet sent a new E-Mail. They've fired a Warning at us</p>
<p><i>I have also been informed that a certain unnamed individual designated officially as an “undesirable” has been in contact with some of you. Any further interaction we become aware of between applicants and this individual may warrant disciplinary action. We are always watching.</i></p>

<p>Back up plan: buy a Tommy gun /s</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:45</strong></p>
<p>We also think they might use the newbies to smoke us out:</p>
<p><i>You can find these various “missions” on our official website. However, some clues to these “missions” are not on the website. To discover these you must engage with applicants who have been here from the beginning.</i></p>
<p><strong>Numbuh 4 — Today at 02:45</strong></p>

<p><strong>ZellaSwiffham — Today at 02:45</strong></p>

<p>The new one that just dropped</p>
<p><strong>ZellaSwiffham — Today at 02:48</strong></p>
<p>uhhh i believe the second, more recent, one</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:48</strong></p>
<p>I know that girl.&nbsp; I've seen her several times near my block!</p>

<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:49</strong></p>
<p>pog then</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:49</strong></p>
<p>This has to be Hanford!</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Today at 02:49</strong></p>
<p>is this the person we know as Hanford?</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 02:49</strong></p>
<p>Lol</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:49</strong></p>
<p>Possibly?</p>
<p>I do know her.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:49</strong></p>
<p>It's something at least!</p>
<p><strong>ZellaSwiffham — Today at 02:49</strong></p>
<p>its a highly likely suspect</p>
<p><strong>Numbuh 4 — Today at 02:49</strong></p>
<p>That’s not completely reassuring</p>
<p>But it’s high probability</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:49</strong></p>
<p>Talked to her once in reference.</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 02:49</strong></p>

<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Today at 02:51</strong></p>
<p>Ahh</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 02:53</strong></p>
<p>The lead seems be hanford @Peach</p>
<p>we've confirmed it</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:53</strong></p>
<p>Ok, we confirmed it. That's Hanford. She releases a song online: <a href="https://beetlebug.bandcamp.com/releases"><u>https://beetlebug.bandcamp.com/releases</u></a></p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:54</strong></p>
<p>Excellent!</p>
<p>Now if only I could make it to the quill.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:55</strong></p>
<p>Now, if I recall, you said Hanford worked with Khan and Mann. Odds are, we can take this lead and work to find them soon as well</p>

<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:58</strong></p>
<p>It seems March mentioned the project on YT in some text under a video she announced in her discord today.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:58</strong></p>
<p>We're aware of her promoting it. It's where the influx of new members came from</p>
<p>Her Discord has a LARGE userbase. around 1100 Members.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:59</strong></p>
<p>I see…</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 03:00</strong></p>
<p>Doesn’t mean ALL of them are coming mind you. I would wager no more than a couple hundred at best from there specifically. How many a video might bring….unknown</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 03:03</strong></p>
<p>I've been on lockdown all day, several blocks have been. Also there have been frequent check ins. I think I'll need to move my equipment soon.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 03:04</strong></p>
<p>I see. Stay safe Peach</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 03:04</strong></p>

<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 03:04</strong></p>
<p>We understand. Be Safe</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 03:05</strong></p>
<p>I'll probably move it tomorrow.</p>
<p>If they lighten up ever I'll grab the quill notes.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 03:05</strong></p>
<p>We'll likely have plenty of info from them by then. For now, let's not be hasty</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 03:44</strong></p>
<p>Back, the random searches seem over</p>
<p>I got some quill messages</p>
<p><strong>ZellaSwiffham — Today at 03:44</strong></p>

<p>You're starting to sound like scoundrels.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 03:48</strong></p>
<p>It's called Levity. We need a laugh, or we'd lose our minds from all the stuff we deal with</p>
<p><strong>Numbuh 4 — Today at 03:48</strong></p>
<p>If you can't avoid the moles, kill em /j</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 03:48</strong></p>
<p>what shades said</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 03:48</strong></p>
<p>I suppose that is fair.&nbsp; Maybe I'm just losing my sense of humor.&nbsp; Today has been a nightmare.</p>
<p><strong>GOddman — Today at 03:49</strong></p>
<p>especially in the the time that there a lot of sound going on in the grindstone server</p>
<p><strong>Numbuh 4 — Today at 03:49</strong></p>
<p>you don't want to know what I've done the last three days</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 03:49</strong></p>
<p>I can imagine. We all have our bad days. Hell, with what we're dealing with in our world, it feels like it never ends</p>
<p><strong>Numbuh 4 — Today at 03:49</strong></p>
<p>I have done nothing but teleport bread for three days</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 03:49</strong></p>
<p>oh no we need 10 cc of laughter stat</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 03:50</strong></p>
<p>I wish I knew what was happening over there.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 03:50</strong></p>
<p>No... You Really don't....</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 03:50</strong></p>
<p>?</p>
<p><strong>GOddman — Today at 03:50</strong></p>
<p>Oh wait peach how do you not appering to be online in discord?</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 03:50</strong></p>
<p>trust us you don't</p>
<p><strong>Numbuh 4 — Today at 03:50</strong></p>
<p>They're talking about cheese</p>
<p>it's weird</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 03:51</strong></p>
<p>From Political Chaos, to arguments over eveything, to a Virus Ravaging our planet, it's a mess</p>
<p><strong>Numbuh 4 — Today at 03:51</strong></p>
<p>That's life for you</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 03:51</strong></p>
<p>theres chaos and then thereschaos</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Today at 03:51</strong></p>
<p>and also cannibalism was a topic for a while</p>
<p><strong>Numbuh 4 — Today at 03:51</strong></p>
<p>It's all fun and games until you live in Florida</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Today at 03:51</strong></p>
<p>and a lot of cheese talk including reanimation of cheese</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 03:51</strong></p>
<p>DON'T I KNOW IT!</p>
<p><strong>Numbuh 4 — Today at 03:51</strong></p>
<p>oops... sorry bro</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 03:52</strong></p>
<p>It's cool, you didn't know</p>
<p>Besides, I agree</p>
<p><strong>Numbuh 4 — Today at 03:52</strong></p>
<p>my condolences to the 4 teachers that died</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 03:52</strong></p>
<p>"Begin arrangements with Z and have Janet directly address the applicants."</p>
<p><strong>Numbuh 4 — Today at 03:52</strong></p>
<p>even if 3 of them were unvaccinated</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 03:52</strong></p>
<p>Wait... Z?</p>

<p><strong>GOddman — Today at 03:53</strong></p>
<p>maybe a too</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 03:53</strong></p>
<p>It might be a person. Let's see</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 03:53</strong></p>
<p>"Material contribution would stimulate a proof of social as described by Infernal Affairs.&nbsp; Prepare the order and have it distributed for the third applicant mission."</p>
<p><strong>Numbuh 4 — Today at 03:53</strong></p>
<p>the THIRD mission?</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Today at 03:54</strong></p>
<p>Infernal?</p>
<p><strong>Numbuh 4 — Today at 03:54</strong></p>
<p>also i changed my nickname</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 03:54</strong></p>
<p>That's what they call Internal Affairs. I know, it's odd to us</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Today at 03:54</strong></p>
<p>Kk</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 03:55</strong></p>
<p>why the third one</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 03:56</strong></p>
<p>"Verify contribution by Broker Carry within the next interval.&nbsp; Contracts need to be reviewed.&nbsp; The Carry needs to also be set up with a neumann.</p>
<p><strong>Numbuh 4 — Today at 03:56</strong></p>
<p>a... a neumann?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 03:56</strong></p>
<p>Oh lord. There's a lot of new stuff to process here…</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Today at 03:56</strong></p>
<p>Mann is a researcher, right?</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 03:57</strong></p>
<p>peach can you translate that to English for us</p>
<p><strong>Numbuh 4 — Today at 03:57</strong></p>
<p>and Khan</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 03:57</strong></p>
<p>"Mann's contribution has been finalized.&nbsp; Terminate contract until next Hanford assignment but verify with Hanford if we are proceeding with Mann again"</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 03:57</strong></p>
<p>So Mann's part is as needed, not a full researcher</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 03:58</strong></p>
<p>We found Hanford.&nbsp; I have no idea who Mann is or what a Broker Carry is.... or a neumann...</p>
<p>WAIT</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 03:58</strong></p>
<p>???</p>
<p><strong>GOddman — Today at 03:58</strong></p>
<p>we have a lead, right?</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 03:58</strong></p>
<p>whats up peach</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 03:59</strong></p>
<p>"Tell the Broker Carry to begin use of regulation ink.&nbsp; The Orange hurts my eyes."</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 03:59</strong></p>
<p>what</p>
<p>did that say</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 03:59</strong></p>
<p>Does that mean…</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 03:59</strong></p>
<p>oh boy</p>
<p><strong>GOddman — Today at 04:00</strong></p>
<p>is Broker Carry orange?(no actually)</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:00</strong></p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 04:01</strong></p>
<p>Wait... I think they are referring to a broker NAMED Carry</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Today at 04:01</strong></p>
<p>the C's</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:220px;"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/bNhfkX0D5WJDDPOt-dNO9DJFL4g9VLKz-BslUDqz56dP9J7QCI7As8y_Q-ruUfMOwqh2wkbY0FcF1PReBoq6E9c9-YMf7yTC7yg4LgFN7s2D1PeGfDzco9KqHllwyqNDwIane3iw"></figure>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 04:02</strong></p>
<p>A Broker, least in our world, is some who Buys and sells goods for someone else. They might be using Orange Ink for their paperwork. Sounds like they've been working with Janet</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:02</strong></p>
<p>"Congratulate Researcher March but provide her material for social as well as talking points for Hyles and Laidlaw.&nbsp; Consider Carrie's contribution on twitch but do not issue contract until Aetherial Studies is ready."</p>
<p><strong>GOddman — Today at 04:02</strong></p>
<p>oh now we see you typing</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 04:02</strong></p>
<p>So Carrie is a Twitch Streamer. Gives us a Lead</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Today at 04:02</strong></p>
<p>does Carry=Carrie?</p>
<p><strong>GOddman — Today at 04:03</strong></p>
<p>it's good tho</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:03</strong></p>
<p>Carry and Carrie could be the same thing.&nbsp; The quill isn't always the best at distinguishing.</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Today at 04:03</strong></p>
<p>also were all researchers in the main discord server from the 6th of Aug or have more joined at different times after that?</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 04:06</strong></p>
<p>anything else peach?</p>
<p><strong>GOddman — Today at 04:06</strong></p>
<p>no suspects, actually</p>
<p>also what is Carry's gender?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:07</strong></p>
<p>I'm still reading</p>
<p>Broker Carry he/him pronouns.</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 04:08</strong></p>
<p>male then</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:09</strong></p>
<p>Carrie is she</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 04:09</strong></p>
<p>So there's TWO Of them?</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 04:09</strong></p>
<p>oh boy</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Today at 04:09</strong></p>
<p>thats not confusing /s</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 04:09</strong></p>
<p>no not at all</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:10</strong></p>
<p>UMAD is a very confusing place.</p>
<p>Belthid, Belthidian, Belthas, Belthean</p>
<p>Language is confusing</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Today at 04:11</strong></p>
<p>do you know if all of these people are in the project grindstone discord server?</p>
<p>or were before you left</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:11</strong></p>
<p>I don't know...</p>
<p>New name again</p>
<p>Delfin</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 04:13</strong></p>
<p>Again</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:13</strong></p>
<p>thoughts?</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 04:13</strong></p>
<p>Not a clue</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 04:14</strong></p>
<p>Nope</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 04:14</strong></p>
<p>Always more questions than answers</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 04:14</strong></p>
<p>Are they He or She?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:14</strong></p>
<p>He by the looks of it.</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 04:15</strong></p>
<p>2 boys 1 girl</p>
<p>oh my</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 04:15</strong></p>

<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:15</strong></p>
<p>I've seen him at the Whimzy and at Lamented Liens!</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 04:15</strong></p>
<p>BINGO!</p>
<p>He's another VA</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 04:15</strong></p>
<p>boom baby</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 04:15</strong></p>
<p>rather new one</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:17</strong></p>
<p>I'm hope this has been at all helpful.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 04:17</strong></p>
<p>We've gotten a few leads, at least</p>
<p><strong>GOddman — Today at 04:17</strong></p>
<p>anything else?</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 04:17</strong></p>
<p>it was great</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 04:17</strong></p>
<p>Now we just need to figure out who these other new people are</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 04:17</strong></p>
<p>Damn shades! Good on ya!</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:19</strong></p>
<p>Looking through more…</p>
<p><strong>GOddman — Today at 04:20</strong></p>
<p>Pog</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:21</strong></p>
<p>"The experiment I'm sure has been productive but interdepartmental action ought be approved by associated departments.&nbsp; When will we be applying rules and regulations to the applicant pages?"</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 04:21</strong></p>
<p>Hello</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:21</strong></p>
<p>"Need to Know"</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 04:21</strong></p>
<p>They did recently add a channel by that name in the Discord, but it's still empty. Seems someone's getting impatient</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 04:21</strong></p>
<p>of course</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:21</strong></p>
<p>"To what level?"</p>
<p>"Twelve"</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 04:22</strong></p>
<p>Wow</p>
<p><strong>GOddman — Today at 04:22</strong></p>
<p>no way</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 04:22</strong></p>
<p>thats high</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 04:22</strong></p>
<p>Wow! that high a clearance for Rules? Seems wierd</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 04:22</strong></p>
<p>Can you honestly blame them after witnessing the chaos?</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 04:22</strong></p>
<p>Wtf</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:23</strong></p>
<p>"A request for expenditure of healthy expiative by allowance"</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 04:23</strong></p>
<p>What</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 04:23</strong></p>
<p>Still level 12? Hmm what are they hiding</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:23</strong></p>
<p>"Denied"</p>
<p>"Screw you Janet"</p>
<p>"You will be billed"</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 04:24</strong></p>
<p>Hahahaha</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 04:24</strong></p>
<p>Lol</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 04:24</strong></p>
<p>thats funny</p>
<p><strong>GOddman — Today at 04:24</strong></p>
<p>who's asking with janet?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 04:25</strong></p>
<p>Damn, Janet's pissing people off now</p>
<p><strong>GOddman — Today at 04:25</strong></p>
<p>and what do they mean by being billed?</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 04:25</strong></p>
<p>So yelling at janet is a billable offense?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:25</strong></p>
<p>I don't get names just transcripts</p>
<p>Honestly the Rules and Regulations book is so long and changes so often it's practically worthless.</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 04:26</strong></p>
<p>who need rules</p>
<p><strong>GOddman — Today at 04:26</strong></p>
<p>we are already the Outlaws</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 04:27</strong></p>
<p>where we're going we don't need rules</p>
<p><strong>GOddman — Today at 04:27</strong></p>
<p>(for Umad at least)</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:28</strong></p>
<p>Lots of paper…</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 04:31</strong></p>
<p>anything else peach?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:32</strong></p>
<p>Looking</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 04:32</strong></p>
<p>Give them a Minute</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:32</strong></p>
<p>Banter</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 04:32</strong></p>
<p>K</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:32</strong></p>
<p>Wait</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 04:32</strong></p>
<p>???</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 04:32</strong></p>
<p>whats up?</p>
<p><strong>ZellaSwiffham — Today at 04:32</strong></p>
<p>these are different, Peach always uses caps</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:36</strong></p>
<p>It looks like some of the chaos and stalling is on purpose but they can't continue to do this as they have limited time.&nbsp; I think things are going to get busy soon.</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 04:37</strong></p>
<p>oh boy</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Today at 04:37</strong></p>
<p>how valuable is 15 departmental points of commendation?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:38</strong></p>
<p>That again…</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 04:38</strong></p>
<p>Something the matter?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:40</strong></p>
<p>It's something recommended by Culture a long time ago to improve performance and morale but it came as a means of evaluating people for potential advancement.&nbsp; What is did though is make some savage competition.</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Today at 05:19</strong></p>
<p>Does the name Jack64 or Jackie :p have any significance to you Peach?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 05:23</strong></p>
<p>It doesnt</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Today at 05:25</strong></p>
<p>also do you know anything about the cheese cult that seems to be forming in the main server as, UMAD management have said that its a product of quiet observation and is necessary for the admissions process?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 05:25</strong></p>
<p>The...what?</p>
<p><strong>ZellaSwiffham — Today at 05:25</strong></p>
<p>oh right</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Today at 05:25</strong></p>
<p>theres a cult growing withing the server based around cheese</p>
<p><strong>ZellaSwiffham — Today at 05:26</strong></p>
<p>about a dozen of the (mostly new) applicants have created a sect based on cheese</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Today at 05:26</strong></p>
<p>their existance has been noted by UMAD as allowed as long as it doesnt affect performance</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 05:26</strong></p>
<p>……</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 05:27</strong></p>
<p>I'm familiar withthis test too.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 05:28</strong></p>
<p>A test? I would’ve guessed they were only allowing it to keep people entertained while they work behind the scenes</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 05:28</strong></p>
<p>I'm willing to bet everything is a test to them</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 05:28</strong></p>
<p>This is part of it.&nbsp; They also aren't posting rules on purpose.&nbsp; They will come in maybe an interval or two however.</p>
<p><strong>ZellaSwiffham — Today at 05:29</strong></p>
<p>the cheese sect is the test?</p>
<p>or UMAD trying to get chuck to rat you out</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Today at 05:29</strong></p>
<p>would it be considered a good or bad thing to join and follow the cult of cheese and would it be likely that theres an insider from UMAD within the cult to promote the cult to see who joins?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 05:29</strong></p>
<p>Observation without regulation</p>
<p><strong>ZellaSwiffham — Today at 05:30</strong></p>
<p>right, they want to see how people react when they dont have anything else to do?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 05:30</strong></p>
<p>They are learning about the character of the applicants.</p>
<p><strong>ZellaSwiffham — Today at 05:30</strong></p>
<p>Interesting</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 05:30</strong></p>
<p>Seeing how they act in Chaos, so they know how to regulate them. Makes sense</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 05:30</strong></p>
<p>Ah of course</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Today at 05:30</strong></p>
<p>so&nbsp; joining a cult would be bad, i assume</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 05:30</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, best we stay out of that mess</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 05:30</strong></p>
<p>from chaos cames order</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 05:31</strong></p>
<p>Its certainly crazy. But with the amount of new applicants overnight im not surprised it went off the rails.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 05:32</strong></p>
<p>Indeed. I suspect those of us that don’t give in to the cheese might be viewed more highly. We’ll see</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 05:32</strong></p>
<p>I mean, let's be honest, we're a bit chaotic, but in a small group like this, it's easier to stay in control. When it gets that big, you need to have set rules, or all hell breaks loose</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 05:33</strong></p>
<p>For sure. I'll be curious to watch the fallout. And if the 'cheese cult' gets dinged on their scorecard</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Today at 06:06</strong></p>
<p>i could have influence over the cheese cult atm</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 07:20</strong></p>
<p>@Peach ! Pauchik is in grindstone server!</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 07:22</strong></p>
<p>I can't really see it though</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 07:22</strong></p>
<p>He seems to be the first researcher in the server</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 07:22</strong></p>
<p>I know, but its worth mentioning that other staff is joining</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 07:22</strong></p>
<p>From what he says</p>
<p>Also, he was the one who bridged communication</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 08:09</strong></p>
<p>So Pauchik said there's humanoid constructs for security purposes? Do you know what these look like?</p>
<p><strong>ZellaSwiffham — Today at 08:11</strong></p>
<p>we have confirmed the existence of scalies in Dial</p>

<p><strong>ZellaSwiffham — Today at 13:10</strong></p>
<p>oof</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Today at 13:13</strong></p>
<p>to be fair that whole conversation is very confused in general</p>
<p>they start out thinking that there is a UMAD plant within the participants in this call</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:184px;"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/8V7T1vcNk6J3U9SO09Qtq6ypk0jebeaGI84pJJ0WmaUdjiakNYkARH5WJ9f4Mlwc_YcK1ZNu64qRQt7whbmDduXBHJEfcBlk1TGLq08CMFchWh1KXBuWcvEt0ALd9Lm7s5JGwTpc"></figure>
<p>then someone links it to the 'undesirable', which wouldn't make sense, because why would UMAD rat out their own plant / call attention to them?</p>
<p>so i feel like tyler or shades are more suspected as umad plants than anything else right now</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 17:14</strong></p>
<p>I think it's either Jackie or Boy to be honest.</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Today at 17:15</strong></p>
<p>idk who was saying it before but i'm a bit swayed that dowan might be it</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 17:15</strong></p>
<p>You mean the UMAD plant?</p>
<p>Would the UMAD plant be a researcher posing as an applicant?</p>
<p>If there is one.</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Today at 17:15</strong></p>
<p>posing as an applicant, i assume</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 17:16</strong></p>
<p>Though I still have my suspicions on Autumn. Yeah, when we were listening to one sing we all muted and listened then cheered.... then suddenly there was a cultural chat channel.</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 17:16</strong></p>
<p>Although, is there even any evidence for a UMAD plant?</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 17:16</strong></p>
<p>designed for music</p>
<p>I'm going to voice</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 17:16</strong></p>
<p>It could be Autumn, or anyone else in the call at that exact time.</p>
<p>Okay, do we join?</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 17:17</strong></p>
<p>I meant here if anyone wants quick explaining.</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 17:17</strong></p>
<p>What gives us reason to believe there's an mole?</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 17:17</strong></p>
<p>I'll go into the PG chat later</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 17:17</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, seems like the mole idea was from a misunderstanding.</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 17:17</strong></p>
<p>^</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 17:18</strong></p>
<p>Although I don't know unless I know the details of that call, I was asleep at the time.</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 17:18</strong></p>
<p>It literally all started from the fact that I didn't get moved into the new channel</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 17:18</strong></p>
<p>What new channel? Whaddya mean by moved?</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 17:19</strong></p>
<p>Like I was saying. There was a person in voice chat that kept singing and we kept praising. then when we all muted our mics to listen to them sing. When they were done we all cheered and praised them heavily. Then not even two minutes after that happened a music designated chat what made. UMAD nor any of the admins were on at the time and it was getting changed real time for me and Shades</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 17:19</strong></p>
<p>A new voice channel was made and everyone was moved into it except me</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 17:19</strong></p>
<p>I manually moved to it</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 17:19</strong></p>
<p>Ah.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 17:19</strong></p>
<p>I saw the new voice channel and jumped in myself</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 17:19</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, that's pretty odd.</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 17:19</strong></p>
<p>Ah, so did everyone do that?</p>
<p>Or did only the people in this discord not get moved?</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 17:20</strong></p>
<p>Probably. No one said they were moved, just commented on the new chat and jumped to there being a mole</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 17:20</strong></p>
<p>To send us a message?</p>
<p>Oh</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 17:21</strong></p>
<p>With how things happened though, even I believe one of them is a mole</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 17:21</strong></p>
<p>Okay, that in my eyes does seem indicative that UMAD, or someone with admin, acquired information in real time that someone was singing in the chat, and the singer was uncomfortable with the praise.</p>
<p>Then the question of how they acquired information is in question, with there being a mole being one, if not the only, explanation.</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 17:22</strong></p>
<p>Oh, it makes sense now, but surely it could've been pure coincidence that a new voice channel was made?</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 17:22</strong></p>
<p>That is also a good point, how do we know the channel was specifically for singing?</p>
<p>Well, then again, maybe UMAD anticipated that most of the influx of people would be from singer YouTubers.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 17:22</strong></p>
<p>A wise man once said: There’s no such thing as a coincidence</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 17:23</strong></p>
<p>And therefore deduced that people liked to sing.</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 17:23</strong></p>
<p>Look at the channels name</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 17:23</strong></p>
<p>I don't know how to ;-;</p>

<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 17:24</strong></p>
<p>Ah, thanks.</p>
<p>So from the timing, I conclude that it, to me at least, is rather unlikely that the creation of a music forum and the singer's debut are independent events.</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 17:26</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, starting to see that now</p>
<p>Was dowan there in the call?</p>
<p>@Snow_Woman</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Today at 17:26</strong></p>
<p>Yeah</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 17:27</strong></p>
<p>Might be worth keeping an eye on dowan, especially since he seems to know as much as us</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Today at 17:27</strong></p>
<p>this is everyone who was in the call</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:164px;"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/3y0k1pyiEpVIryBVNQgaSbj9drvet3x5-FU-2jrPJKRbwkqZxRgM3cn2wolB5iXLdjH_G3pi2dccZk3eiuqroeYIZrXgqLPRZz77zqnDLHf0HISOO5DOVS2A2B5Z5bSNCPYsRkLN"></figure>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 17:27</strong></p>
<p>Hopefully Dowan and I are bonding over our mutual love of science fiction.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 17:28</strong></p>
<p>Yeah he's on my list of suspects as well</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Today at 17:28</strong></p>
<p>these are all the possibility, its possible the cheese people are involved but i doubt it</p>

<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 17:29</strong></p>
<p>Between boy, jackie, autumn, and dowan for me.</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 17:29</strong></p>
<p>We can guess anyone that turned on facecan yesterday is clean</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Today at 17:29</strong></p>
<p>i did tell you all that Dowan and Jack64 were one's to watch</p>
<p>facecam was only Boy, right?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 17:29</strong></p>
<p>No, there were several</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 17:29</strong></p>
<p>naw I was facecamming too</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 17:30</strong></p>
<p>How would we conclude this statement?</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Today at 17:30</strong></p>
<p>i went to bed so i didnt see them all</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 17:30</strong></p>
<p>Boy, Dowan, Cheesepope, i think all of them were on cam</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 17:30</strong></p>
<p>Dowan wasn't on cam</p>
<p>Think he left when we switched to facecam</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 17:30</strong></p>
<p>Oh, Could have sworn I saw them.</p>
<p>Then again it was late for me</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 17:31</strong></p>
<p>Alec also had facecam on</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Today at 17:32</strong></p>
<p>so Boy, Cheesepope and Alec but not Dowan.</p>
<p>also we should probably move to pitschat rather than flood this channel bcs of the transcript</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:44</strong></p>
<p>How is everyone</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Today at 18:45</strong></p>
<p>i am alright, how are you?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 18:45</strong></p>
<p>Doing alright. Just watching the Chaos unfold in the main chat</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:46</strong></p>
<p>Tired but I'm fine.&nbsp; Chaos?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 18:46</strong></p>
<p>They haven't added the Rules yet, so a lot of the others in the server have just been acting really goofy</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Today at 18:47</strong></p>
<p>at the moment the people seem to think there is something hidden in the poem on the FaQ page of the website</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 18:47</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, they tried looking at the first letters of each lines and running them through decryption tools.</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Today at 18:47</strong></p>
<p>and also anagrams</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:47</strong></p>
<p>Poem?</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 18:47</strong></p>

<p>its also the equivalent of Dutch here</p>

<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:50</strong></p>
<p>It's talking about Alchemist Dust.&nbsp; A very popular alchemical reagent that creates euphoria, loss of some sensation, and heightened activity when ingested recreationally.</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Today at 18:50</strong></p>
<p>so its a recreational drug?</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 18:50</strong></p>
<p>So like cocaine on our plane.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 18:50</strong></p>
<p>Sounds like Cannibus, a Plant-based drug in our world</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 18:51</strong></p>
<p>Yeah Cannibis is a better analogy, I was focused on it being a powder.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:52</strong></p>
<p>Looking into both of these.</p>
<p><strong>ZellaSwiffham — Today at 18:53</strong></p>
<p>is alchemist dust legal in Dial?</p>
<p>a lot of drugs, recreational or otherwise, are veeeery illegal here</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 18:54</strong></p>
<p>Well, depends on where you are.</p>
<p><strong>ZellaSwiffham — Today at 18:54</strong></p>
<p>yeah thats true, but in the general sense</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 18:54</strong></p>
<p>Mainly due to be being very addictive and some rather dangerous to our bodies. Cannibus is more debatable, with it becoming more accepted these days</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Today at 18:56</strong></p>
<p>ive made contact with Pauchik and im trying to see if theres an in for me at Necromancy</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 18:56</strong></p>
<p>Tread Carefully</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Today at 18:56</strong></p>
<p>will do</p>
<p>is there anything with Pauchik i should watch out for, or anything that might get me closer to them?</p>
<p>interesting</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:624px;"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/BTbqIFuOlzd_zxU35rcnkPyO3cQzWZzbva2OdZwgxabtmul8WuR3t4envVcAJgtEhkPSmhDzWB7vp108LlLoehsfxqhIP82xNinqPZErgUrwM28hxtcPccPqC-OAvQ6DLB5APgUN"></figure>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 19:00</strong></p>
<p>Careful. From what we know, if you get him going, he might be hard to stop talking about his "Hobby"</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Today at 19:02</strong></p>
<p>necromancy is interesting, and if hes talking a lot that could be interpreted as a friendship that could allow me to get into the necromancy department easier</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 19:03</strong></p>
<p>Only 3rd grade and above is illegal.&nbsp; But you can carry 3rd if you have a permit.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 19:03</strong></p>
<p>Not that much different from here. Cannibus has reach a similar point of getting a permit in some areas.</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Today at 19:04</strong></p>

<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:39</strong></p>
<p>I'm back.&nbsp; they called for a multi-departmental meeting.&nbsp; I started scrambling and was out the door about 40 ticks ago</p>
<p>Maybe they are branching out</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Today at 20:41</strong></p>
<p>branching out?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:41</strong></p>
<p>Creating a new campus</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 20:41</strong></p>
<p>Is it also in Dial?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:41</strong></p>
<p>But I don't think that's the case</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 20:41</strong></p>
<p>Ah.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:41</strong></p>
<p>Dial is one campus</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:42</strong></p>
<p>I suspect it's a construct to allow better connection to our world</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:42</strong></p>
<p>a Universal Magical Academy at X</p>
<p>I don't know many cities in your world</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:43</strong></p>
<p>A lot. We're a pretty Populated world</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 20:43</strong></p>
<p>On the order of ~10,000.</p>
<p>We have a population of ~7.8 billion.</p>
<p>Well, could be ~100,000 too, depends on how you define cities.</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Today at 20:45</strong></p>
<p>Could the new Campus be the tower Pauchik was talking about?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:47</strong></p>
<p>That's what I'm suggesting</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Today at 20:48</strong></p>
<p>And it's somewhere in our world, right?</p>
<p>So you know what country it will be in?</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 20:49</strong></p>
<p>And will this tower be located close to where our planes are bridged?</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Today at 20:49</strong></p>
<p>The most likely country is The United States</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 20:49</strong></p>
<p>Like planar overlap?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:51</strong></p>
<p>This is speculation.&nbsp; We don't know what they are up to yet</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 20:51</strong></p>
<p>Fair.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:52</strong></p>
<p>I'm thinking if I should make a mole account for the chat or if it's too dangerous</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 20:53</strong></p>
<p>Hm... do we have any idea on how they might find out the mole account is the "undesirable"?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:54</strong></p>
<p>They make it their mission to be in the know on things.&nbsp; Whatever technology or spell they need is probably only a matter of time before they find it or how</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 20:58</strong></p>
<p>For the mole account, do you intend to use it solely for observation, or also interaction?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:58</strong></p>
<p>Interaction seems risky</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 20:58</strong></p>
<p>That it does.</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Today at 20:58</strong></p>
<p>Simple interactions such as saying hello when you join I imagine is harmless</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:58</strong></p>
<p>I actually disagree. If you do it right, talking with everyone might make you stick out less.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 20:59</strong></p>
<p>We're running an undercover spy operation. Everything we do is risky</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 20:59</strong></p>
<p>Anyone familiar with the limits it's possible to program a fake account to run a script ad infinitum, without it being an actual bot?</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 21:00</strong></p>
<p>The question to be considered is if the potential gains outweigh the risks</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 21:00</strong></p>
<p>I'm sorta worried that UMAD might pick up the regular transfer of data from Peach's device to the UMAD server if they interact too much.</p>
<p>But I don't know how that would be implemented, however.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 21:00</strong></p>
<p>Just talking with us brings that same risk. So not much riskier to be part of the main chat.</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 21:01</strong></p>
<p>Ah, true. It's being transported to the same Discord physical server anyways I suppose, that'd be a lot of data to track, especially considering UMAD's own interaction with this plane.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 21:02</strong></p>
<p>Yeah. It's more a matter of saying anything that stands out. If they blend in with the other applicants, no one will even bat an eye</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 21:03</strong></p>
<p>That statement I agree with, they wouldn't suspect an applicant that seems normal.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 21:04</strong></p>
<p>Perhaps attempt to solve the puzzles, but not solve them on their own, so it seems like they don't know anything. Then it's just playing along with the others, even cracking a joke or two if they can</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 21:04</strong></p>
<p>I can do my best I suppose</p>
<p>I'll think on it a bit more.&nbsp; If I make an account I'll let you know</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 21:05</strong></p>
<p>If you do, I suggest we do not add it here. Harder to trace it back to us if we don't</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 21:06</strong></p>
<p>Probably a good idea</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 21:08</strong></p>
<p>I agree</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 21:21</strong></p>
<p>I'd say you'll have to be really careful if you do make a new account and come back onto the server. UMAD proposed to me the job of trying to track down the undesirable, which I declined but it gives me reason to believe they'll ask more people to do it.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 21:25</strong></p>
<p>I'm certain they will.</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 21:29</strong></p>
<p>Wouldnt you taking that job be good though? Gives us an in to throw them off the trail</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Today at 21:30</strong></p>
<p>that would mean chuck wouldnt make any progress with umad though, since taking this job would necessitate doing it poorly</p>
<p>also they've already declined it, i think it might be a bit suspicious to suddenly take it now</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 21:31</strong></p>

<p>I said I was interested in the moderator job, plus if I end up feeding them false information that can put a target on my back if they're smart enough. Being a moderator however gives me higher clearance and puts me in an immediate position of trust with UMAD.</p>

<p>It's a good Compromise</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 21:37</strong></p>
<p>at the end of the day I'd rather keep up the "oh I'm just a really enthusiastic applicant" schtick rather than be a completely active saboteur, it'll help us in the long run</p>

<p>Very... forward person</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Yesterday at 23:34</strong></p>
<p>shes just joined the main server</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Yesterday at 23:34</strong></p>
<p>They joined seconds ago</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Yesterday at 23:34</strong></p>
<p>I can tell, she's blunt so far.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 23:34</strong></p>
<p>She has a bit of a temper.</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Yesterday at 23:34</strong></p>

<p>I do have some advice, she really enjoys botony</p>
<p>the boring, boring study of botony</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Yesterday at 23:36</strong></p>
<p>She's a plant nerd</p>

<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Yesterday at 23:36</strong></p>
<p>I like the cut of her jib!</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Yesterday at 23:36</strong></p>

<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 23:36</strong></p>
<p>To each their own</p>
<p>I find the study a little tedious myself.</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Yesterday at 23:37</strong></p>
<p>you are named after a fruit, i dont think you can complain</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 23:37</strong></p>
<p>I suppose that's fair</p>
<p>it's just an alias</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Yesterday at 23:37</strong></p>
<p>Hey now, no need to be rude</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Yesterday at 23:37</strong></p>
<p>i was only joking around</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 23:38</strong></p>
<p>I know, sorry I've been such an ass lately.</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Yesterday at 23:38</strong></p>
<p>it's all good, it's a very tense period</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Yesterday at 23:38</strong></p>
<p>i disagree, youve been very helpful and friendly especially given how difficult it sounds like its been for you</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Yesterday at 23:39</strong></p>
<p>No need to apologize. Undoubtably things have been quite stressful on your end. The gears are in motion and they keep grinding</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Yesterday at 23:39</strong></p>
<p>We're all on the same team. I took emry's comment in more harsh a tone than it was meant. Thats on me.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 23:39</strong></p>
<p>There has just been a lot of signs of danger lately.&nbsp; I sometimes wonder if maybe I overstepped or if maybe I'm just wrong</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Yesterday at 23:39</strong></p>
<p>I feel that</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Yesterday at 23:40</strong></p>
<p>what do you mean by overstepped?</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Yesterday at 23:40</strong></p>
<p>Unfortunately, sometimes all you can do is just move forward</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Yesterday at 23:40</strong></p>
<p>There are risks but I dont think youre wrong</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 23:41</strong></p>
<p>Just acted foolishly.&nbsp; I sometimes doubt what I'm doing is right.&nbsp; This institution exists because of the direction of Rameus and we do a lot of good…</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Yesterday at 23:41</strong></p>
<p>I mean, we already know UMAD is targeting one of us, foreign nationals, for a biological experiment. I'd say that's cause enough to have some doubt towards them.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Yesterday at 23:42</strong></p>
<p>It's ok Peach, I don't think you need me to explain that things have been stressful</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Yesterday at 23:42</strong></p>
<p>If out world is anything to go off of, an institution with the backing of the government may do a lot of good, but that doesnt mean theyre innocent. People often do terrible things in the pursuit of the greater good</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Yesterday at 23:42</strong></p>
<p>The main idea is of good intention, but there may be bad apples that could corrupt that ideal. They need to be investigated, and if there is a danger, it needs to be stopped</p>
<p>"The Road to Hell is Paved with Good Intentions"</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 23:43</strong></p>
<p>I read recently that the funding for Grindstone was signed off on by the Assistant Headmaster.&nbsp; I have a lot of respect for him and Headmaster.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Yesterday at 23:44</strong></p>
<p>Respect doesn't mean blind faith. One should always question things like this. We're here cause we seek the truth. If all's good, we back off, but if there's any chance they're up to something bad, we'll make sure it doesn't happen.</p>
<p>You suspected something was Amiss. Do not question your instincts. Often, your gut is pointing you in the right direction</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 23:46</strong></p>
<p>If we were wrong though and we back off I'll likely be in danger for the foreseeable future</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Yesterday at 23:46</strong></p>
<p>That is why we keep investigating till we know for sure. We know the risks, but we're not backing down. We're in this till the end. Hell, I have to be</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Yesterday at 23:46</strong></p>
<p>i have an in with Pauchik and he seems to have some questionable morals</p>
<p>so&nbsp; maybe thatll lead somewhere</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 23:48</strong></p>
<p>Questionable morals?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Yesterday at 23:48</strong></p>
<p>Their Hobby doesn't seem to be a very safe idea</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Yesterday at 23:49</strong></p>
<p>We all knew we would be taking risks when we signed on. We still made that decision and we'll stick by it. If UMAD is up to something fishy, we'll find out</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 23:49</strong></p>
<p>It's harmless...just creepy</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Yesterday at 23:49</strong></p>
<p>from my understanding he drew a thin line between life and death</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 23:49</strong></p>
<p>How so?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Yesterday at 23:50</strong></p>
<p>He's playing God. In our world, that has NEVER ended well for us</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Yesterday at 23:50</strong></p>
<p>He's in Necromancy. That's as thin it gets between life and death</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 23:51</strong></p>
<p>I don't understand the meaning of playing god?</p>
<p>We all emulate gods.&nbsp; That is the spread of domains</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Yesterday at 23:51</strong></p>
<p>Well, in our world we have set lines on how we conduct ourselves.</p>
<p>Playing god I suppose would be overstepping those lines.</p>
<p>Like, ethics committees say that we can't clone humans, or grow them in, say, a glass tube. Playing god would be doing just that.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Yesterday at 23:52</strong></p>
<p>It may seem normal in your world, but we have a saying ours: "Power Corrupts, and Absolute Power Corrupts Absolutely"</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 23:53</strong></p>
<p>I still don't understand what you mean by playing god</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Yesterday at 23:54</strong></p>
<p>all power must be held accountable, peach</p>
<p>no amount of good can justify evil, and we're here to find out where UMAD's actions lie</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Yesterday at 23:55</strong></p>
<p>On a different note, does the name "Shakespeare" mean anything in your world Peach?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 23:55</strong></p>
<p>I'm not sure what you mean by evil…</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Yesterday at 23:56</strong></p>
<p>I ask because someone was drawing comparisons between King Orthelo and a similarly named character from a work of literature in our world</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Yesterday at 23:57</strong></p>
<p>Well, since we don't have gods, we sorta define "good" and "evil" in the context of humans themselves. There are many ways to define good/evil and moral/immoral actions, for example the Utilitarian school of thought that says something along the lines of good is maximizing net societal pleasure, and evil is minimizing net societal pleasure.</p>
<p>Then there's a man named Kant who said that people have lines to not cross, and in all your actions, you must not cross those lines.</p>
<p>...at least I think he said that. I dunno.</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Yesterday at 23:58</strong></p>
<p>in a lot more words, yes</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 23:59</strong></p>
<p>Hmm....&nbsp; I don't often think of the good and the moral being so close.</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Yesterday at 23:59</strong></p>
<p>ah, we sometimes utilize good to mean moral</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 23:59</strong></p>
<p>The moral is based in perspective and is social while the good is rational.</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Yesterday at 23:59</strong></p>
<p>in what way is the good rational?</p>
<h2>16th August 2021</h2>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 00:00</strong></p>
<p>Well, I think when good has sufficient axioms defined, good actions can be described by logical operations on those axioms.</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Today at 00:00</strong></p>
<p>in that most people have some inherent moral compass regardless of how they are raised</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 00:00</strong></p>
<p>At least, that's how it is here. Maybe y'all have more definite axioms on your plane? We don't really know what to say are our axioms.</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Today at 00:00</strong></p>
<p>yes, but it is unclear how axioms can be established objectively or rationally</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Today at 00:01</strong></p>
<p>that's not rational though, that's intrinsic</p>
<p>appeal to reason is different from appeal to nature</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 00:01</strong></p>
<p>Dude you're speaking my language.</p>
<p>But yeah, here we don't know how to even define good or evil, so it's hard to have one logical system for it.</p>
<p>One might even argue it depends on how you define your axioms I guess.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:03</strong></p>
<p>You seem to be mistaken.&nbsp; Goods are rational and have direct value.&nbsp; An associated qualitative value.&nbsp; Morality is how society seems to attempt to maximize goods but is necessitated but a reaction based on understanding.</p>
<p>I meant quantitative</p>
<p>not qualitative.</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 00:03</strong></p>
<p>Wait what? You have a quantitative description of good?</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Today at 00:04</strong></p>
<p>you have a points based system of whats good, amazing</p>
<p>basically The Good Place</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 00:04</strong></p>
<p>Do you mind if I ask how this system is formulated? Does it employ divine intervention?</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Today at 00:04</strong></p>
<p>but what you just said is intrinsically a value judgement</p>
<p>even if you can quantify good according to a system, how do you actually know if it's correct?</p>
<p>how do you define a good act within this system? how do you evaluate edge cases?</p>
<p>sorry if i'm asking too many questions by the way</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 00:06</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, like if there's a quantitative measurement of good y'all have, we have no idea how it works over here.</p>
<p>Sounds fascinating though.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:06</strong></p>
<p>Look...&nbsp; lets start somewhere more elementary</p>
<p>Language often defines good without a clear observation.&nbsp; We use the word good but don't always consider it.&nbsp; Good is a word that is elementary you can describe something as good but you cannot describe good as something else.&nbsp; All language has a quantitative and qualitative element.&nbsp; Words are made up of sets, these sets like in math are an arrangement of values.&nbsp; These values are other words and so we call them definitions.&nbsp; The words of the definitions then have further sub-sets.</p>
<p>This is called logic of language.</p>
<p>The ability to fulfill an entire set is called perfection.&nbsp; the ability not to exist outside the set is called beauty and is part of the study of aesthetics</p>
<p>The more that something fulfills its definition the more good it is.&nbsp; Goodness is the fulfillment of something.&nbsp; To act in one's nature and seek perfection of that nature is the act of being good where the spread of a particular domain is a good.</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Today at 00:10</strong></p>
<p>i have a quick question here</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 00:10</strong></p>
<p>Oh, so X is good if it is the best X it could be?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:10</strong></p>
<p>A cup for instance that cannot carry fluids is a bad cup if the cup is defined to carry liquids</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Today at 00:11</strong></p>
<p>you mention that good is elementary and cannot be described as something else</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 00:11</strong></p>
<p>This sounds eerily similar to the idea of Platonic solids, an idea espoused millennia ago by a man named Plato. He said geometric shapes exist in a separate plane of existence, and all objects strive to mimic those shapes.</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Today at 00:11</strong></p>
<p>but here you define good as the fulfillment of one's essence</p>
<p>to clarify: fulfilling one's essence is accomplishing a purpose one is given; in your terms, accomplishing the goal of the set one belongs to</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:12</strong></p>
<p>Do not mistake good and to be good</p>
<p>This is where the language we use has limitations</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Today at 00:13</strong></p>
<p>so you cannot define good, but you can somehow ascribe it to things?</p>
<p><strong>Numbuh 362 — Today at 00:13</strong></p>
<p>Peach</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 00:13</strong></p>
<p>So good is just actualization of its purpose, the fulfillment of the striving in the theory of Platonic solids?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:13</strong></p>
<p>To fulfill oneself entirely is to be perfect not good.&nbsp; Goodness is quantitative in this way.</p>
<p><strong>Numbuh 362 — Today at 00:13</strong></p>
<p>I am obligated to kidnap you</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 00:13</strong></p>
<p>Oh god.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:13</strong></p>
<p>What?</p>
<p><strong>Numbuh 362 — Today at 00:13</strong></p>
<p>Bowser joke</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Today at 00:13</strong></p>
<p>bowser please we're having a socratic discussion</p>
<p>Sfhsjfjf</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 00:14</strong></p>
<p>(He's doing a reference, to a game from our world.)</p>
<p>In this game there's a man named Mario who must rescue a woman named Princess Peach, who is kidnapped by a turtle man named Bowser.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 00:14</strong></p>
<p>@Numbuh 362 I told you I know how to get in touch with Mario xD</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Today at 00:14</strong></p>
<p>so good quantifies how much one fulfills their purpose?</p>
<p><strong>Numbuh 362 — Today at 00:14</strong></p>
<p>I am Mario</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 00:14</strong></p>
<p>Wait wh-</p>
<p>OKAY back to how we define good.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:15</strong></p>
<p>Sure?</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Today at 00:15</strong></p>
<p>excuse that interruption</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 00:15</strong></p>
<p>So, question, if good is the fulfillment of ones essence, who defines what the essence of something is?</p>
<p>The maker, I'd assume?</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 00:17</strong></p>
<p>The god of that domain id guess? The god of 'cups' or 'holiding liquid' to go with our earlier example, of such a domain exists</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Today at 00:17</strong></p>
<p>also, there is an implicit assumption here that essence precedes existence, isn't there?</p>
<p>in other words, that the definition one ought to fulfill is set in stone and that they are born into it</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:17</strong></p>
<p>The definition is uncertain and so people attempt instead to emulate gods</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 00:17</strong></p>
<p>Yeah. I was wondering if the regular divine intervention that exists in that plane allows them to realize this definition of good far more better than we could.</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 00:17</strong></p>
<p>Ah, so do they align themselves towards a certain divine domain and mimic the gods of those domains?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:17</strong></p>
<p>By being close to their god in life they hope when they die they will be physically closer to their god in death, a perpetuity</p>
<p>Failure typical means going elsewhere.&nbsp; Far from one's god</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 00:18</strong></p>
<p>Okay, but what if one chooses to align themselves with no god? Do they just disappear when they die? Their souls I mean.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:19</strong></p>
<p>No</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Today at 00:19</strong></p>
<p>but if the definitions are uncertain, how can this system of good actually evaluate actions?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:20</strong></p>
<p>Those who don't wish to be judged by Qoseem in accordance with a particular faith find closeness with Malignus.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:20</strong></p>
<p>I'm not an expert on religious studies.&nbsp; In fact I'm a bad practitioner of my own faith.</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Today at 00:20</strong></p>
<p>that's understandable</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 00:20</strong></p>
<p>Slightly personal question if you don't mind, what god do you align yourself with?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:24</strong></p>
<p>I suppose that one is a little safer than my gender or department…</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Today at 00:24</strong></p>
<p>no pressure!!</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:24</strong></p>
<p>I worship Alligans god of contracts.</p>
<p>He resides near Ananakeia in the infernal perpetuity.</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 00:25</strong></p>
<p>Is Ananakeia in a separate ring?</p>
<p>Wait, yeah, pretty sure it'd be. Like seventh or ninth ring?</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 00:26</strong></p>
<p>God of Contracts?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:26</strong></p>
<p>Not the ninth</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 00:26</strong></p>
<p>Oh, yeah, sorry for interrupting.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:27</strong></p>
<p>Thats the other side.&nbsp; Not much is known about it</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 00:27</strong></p>
<p>Interesting, I have much to learn on the structure of the universe.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:27</strong></p>
<p>The first ring is where you and I are although my world is three plans in constant direct overlay</p>
<p>planes*</p>
<p>eight is the center of all things</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 00:28</strong></p>
<p>And it's all fine there? No wacky spontaneous plane warpings?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:28</strong></p>
<p>Actually... it happens often</p>
<p>The dead that escape Quoseem's extensions sometimes appear here.</p>
<p>We use the Shadow often though for certain spells and practice.</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 00:30</strong></p>
<p>So your plane has a direct overlap with Quoseem's plane? I assume he has a plane since you mention things escaping from Quoseem's extensions.</p>
<p>And what does Shadow mean? A medium for spellcasting?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:32</strong></p>
<p>No.. Qoseem exists in judgement</p>
<p>The Shadow, The Etherial, and the Material were all once one place if you believe that sort of thing.</p>
<p>Death was handled very differently back then apparently.</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 00:34</strong></p>
<p>So the Material, means planar? Aetherial means the aetherial matrix itself I'd take it, and is Shadow the aspect of... I'm not quite sure, but I imagine the afterlife? Somehow?</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 00:36</strong></p>
<p>I think peach means that the aetherial, material, and shadow are all planes that exist basically on top of each other?</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Today at 00:36</strong></p>
<p>maybe purgatory</p>
<p>aren't all planes material though?</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 00:37</strong></p>
<p>I can see that, like three-fold planar overlap. Although I thought the definition of a plane was a space vacated of aether fluid?</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Today at 00:37</strong></p>
<p>^</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:37</strong></p>
<p>The Aetherial is not the Etherial.&nbsp; Yet more confusing words</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Today at 00:37</strong></p>
<p>oh no</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 00:37</strong></p>
<p>Ah, sorry. Thought it was a typo.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:37</strong></p>
<p>Yet these have been commonly accepted terms for a long time</p>
<p>Culture needs to sort all that out eventually</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 00:39</strong></p>
<p>Figures. So is Shadow purgatory like was suggested? And that's a plane that overlaps with yours, allowing the dead to come through to your place?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:40</strong></p>
<p>I don't know what purgatory is</p>
<p>Sorry, didn't read all that</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 00:40</strong></p>
<p>Well, it's essentially the land of the dead.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:40</strong></p>
<p>Also not an expert in this...&nbsp; Shadow is the material but... different?</p>
<p>Ah</p>
<p>We call that Judgement</p>
<p>Where you await the ruling of Qoseem</p>

<p>yes, that's purgatory for us</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 00:41</strong></p>
<p>Ah, right, yeah.</p>

<p>liminal space between life and afterlife</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 00:41</strong></p>
<p>Got confused on how we defined it.</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 00:43</strong></p>
<p>Would an expert in Planar studies be someone good to consult with on this?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:43</strong></p>
<p>Definitely</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 00:47</strong></p>
<p>WTF what did i miss?!</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 00:47</strong></p>
<p>Philosophy and gods and planes.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:47</strong></p>
<p>Apparently a conversation on ethics and the setup of my world</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 00:48</strong></p>
<p>Ooookkkkk</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 00:51</strong></p>
<p>how do you guys harvest this shadow?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:52</strong></p>
<p>Harvest?</p>
<p>It's a place.&nbsp; I don't understand</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 00:52</strong></p>
<p>oh, my bad, I have trouble following a conversation sometimes :joy:</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 00:53</strong></p>
<p>Is Shadow a part of Judgement? Or do some people get sorted there by Quoseem?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:53</strong></p>
<p>Shadow is a plane on the first ring that has a continuous overlay here.</p>
<p>I'll try to give a breakdown but I'm no expert</p>
<p>The shadow, etherial (not aether), and material exist within the first ring and have constant seemingly random overlays.&nbsp; The second ring is Oberidian and hosts the closest god to us with his extensions.&nbsp; The third hosts elemental planes which are essentially storage for elementals which keep our world mostly cleaned up if they are naturalized.</p>
<p>Note there are other planes within the rings but I don't really know many of them</p>
<p>Eight is the center, no idea what seven is, six is the perpetuities mostly, five judgement, four some other things.</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 00:57</strong></p>
<p>I see, so Shadow is just a drifting spooky world in the first ring? Like a plane full of monsters and ghouls that just drifts wherever?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:58</strong></p>
<p>Why would you assume that?</p>
<p>It's another place although I know little about it</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 00:59</strong></p>
<p>I thought you said monsters cross over from one of the planes that overlaps your world into your world.</p>
<p>Although now I recall, I shouldn't assume that plane is Shadow.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:59</strong></p>
<p>The dead sometimes cross over</p>
<p>Ghosts</p>
<p>and that is the Etherial</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 01:01</strong></p>
<p>Ohhhh. So the Etherial plane is the extension of Quoseem? And Shadow is, well you said you use it for spells.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:01</strong></p>
<p>The extensions are creatures</p>
<p>Beings</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 01:01</strong></p>
<p>Aye.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:01</strong></p>
<p>I shouldn't say creatures</p>
<p>They are entities with different functions but serve directly a god.&nbsp; With Qoseem they tend to guide the dead to Judgement</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 01:02</strong></p>
<p>Okay, I can see how that has me reinterpret what you said about the dead escaping.</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 01:03</strong></p>
<p>So extentions might be what wed call angels</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 01:03</strong></p>
<p>Or psychopomps, in the general term.</p>
<p>Given that psychopomps are literally guides for ghosts.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:03</strong></p>
<p>I'll need to do more research I suppose</p>
<p>Not every extension is a guide.</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 01:05</strong></p>
<p>Beings of a divine nature that serve a god. Qoseem's extensions sound like what we'd consider a grim reaper like entity to be, in function if not appearance. Guiding the dead to judgement</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 01:05</strong></p>
<p>Or perhaps whatever else function Qoseem deems fit.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:06</strong></p>
<p>Anything to spread their domain</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 01:06</strong></p>
<p>So you said that the dead escaping extensions of Qoseem, that's due to the three-fold planar overlap at your world, yeah? So I would assume that one of the planes in that planar overlap is your world, and another is one where Qoseem's extensions interact with the dead, from which the dead escape? What's the third plane that overlaps?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:07</strong></p>
<p>The Etherial is where they usually are.&nbsp; When one dies they often find themselves there to be claimed and guided by Qoseem's extensions</p>

<p>Someone in the main channel just asked an interesting question, are there people that work for multiple departments? Or is everyone limited to their own single department?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:13</strong></p>
<p>All singular department roles.</p>
<p>But, there are multi departmental obligations and studies</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Today at 01:13</strong></p>
<p>is there never a need for people with multiple specializations?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:14</strong></p>
<p>People cross specializations but we are only assigned to a single department.</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Today at 01:14</strong></p>
<p>I know necromancy seems to be working with everyone to allows visual communication between our world's, are there any more prominent cross-department projects going on</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:14</strong></p>
<p>Project Grindstone</p>
<p>But yeah, several</p>
<p>Although being assigned to one as an assistant is rare</p>
<p>When you become a researcher you might luck into field research if that is your thing.&nbsp; It certainly isn't for everyone.</p>
<p>And not many get the option</p>
