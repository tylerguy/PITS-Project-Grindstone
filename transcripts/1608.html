<p>Well, I think when good has sufficient axioms defined, good actions can be described by logical operations on those axioms.</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Today at 00:00</strong></p>
<p>in that most people have some inherent moral compass regardless of how they are raised</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 00:00</strong></p>
<p>At least, that's how it is here. Maybe y'all have more definite axioms on your plane? We don't really know what to say are our axioms.</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Today at 00:00</strong></p>
<p>yes, but it is unclear how axioms can be established objectively or rationally</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Today at 00:01</strong></p>
<p>that's not rational though, that's intrinsic</p>
<p>appeal to reason is different from appeal to nature</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 00:01</strong></p>
<p>Dude you're speaking my language.</p>
<p>But yeah, here we don't know how to even define good or evil, so it's hard to have one logical system for it.</p>
<p>One might even argue it depends on how you define your axioms I guess.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:03</strong></p>
<p>You seem to be mistaken.&nbsp; Goods are rational and have direct value.&nbsp; An associated qualitative value.&nbsp; Morality is how society seems to attempt to maximize goods but is necessitated but a reaction based on understanding.</p>
<p>I meant quantitative</p>
<p>not qualitative.</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 00:03</strong></p>
<p>Wait what? You have a quantitative description of good?</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Today at 00:04</strong></p>
<p>you have a points based system of whats good, amazing</p>
<p>basically The Good Place</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 00:04</strong></p>
<p>Do you mind if I ask how this system is formulated? Does it employ divine intervention?</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Today at 00:04</strong></p>
<p>but what you just said is intrinsically a value judgement</p>
<p>even if you can quantify good according to a system, how do you actually know if it's correct?</p>
<p>how do you define a good act within this system? how do you evaluate edge cases?</p>
<p>sorry if i'm asking too many questions by the way</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 00:06</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, like if there's a quantitative measurement of good y'all have, we have no idea how it works over here.</p>
<p>Sounds fascinating though.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:06</strong></p>
<p>Look...&nbsp; lets start somewhere more elementary</p>
<p>Language often defines good without a clear observation.&nbsp; We use the word good but don't always consider it.&nbsp; Good is a word that is elementary you can describe something as good but you cannot describe good as something else.&nbsp; All language has a quantitative and qualitative element.&nbsp; Words are made up of sets, these sets like in math are an arrangement of values.&nbsp; These values are other words and so we call them definitions.&nbsp; The words of the definitions then have further sub-sets.</p>
<p>This is called logic of language.</p>
<p>The ability to fulfill an entire set is called perfection.&nbsp; the ability not to exist outside the set is called beauty and is part of the study of aesthetics</p>
<p>The more that something fulfills its definition the more good it is.&nbsp; Goodness is the fulfillment of something.&nbsp; To act in one's nature and seek perfection of that nature is the act of being good where the spread of a particular domain is a good.</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Today at 00:10</strong></p>
<p>i have a quick question here</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 00:10</strong></p>
<p>Oh, so X is good if it is the best X it could be?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:10</strong></p>
<p>A cup for instance that cannot carry fluids is a bad cup if the cup is defined to carry liquids</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Today at 00:11</strong></p>
<p>you mention that good is elementary and cannot be described as something else</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 00:11</strong></p>
<p>This sounds eerily similar to the idea of Platonic solids, an idea espoused millennia ago by a man named Plato. He said geometric shapes exist in a separate plane of existence, and all objects strive to mimic those shapes.</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Today at 00:11</strong></p>
<p>but here you define good as the fulfillment of one's essence</p>
<p>to clarify: fulfilling one's essence is accomplishing a purpose one is given; in your terms, accomplishing the goal of the set one belongs to</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:12</strong></p>
<p>Do not mistake good and to be good</p>
<p>This is where the language we use has limitations</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Today at 00:13</strong></p>
<p>so you cannot define good, but you can somehow ascribe it to things?</p>
<p><strong>Numbuh 362 — Today at 00:13</strong></p>
<p>Peach</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 00:13</strong></p>
<p>So good is just actualization of its purpose, the fulfillment of the striving in the theory of Platonic solids?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:13</strong></p>
<p>To fulfill oneself entirely is to be perfect not good.&nbsp; Goodness is quantitative in this way.</p>
<p><strong>Numbuh 362 — Today at 00:13</strong></p>
<p>I am obligated to kidnap you</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 00:13</strong></p>
<p>Oh god.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:13</strong></p>
<p>What?</p>
<p><strong>Numbuh 362 — Today at 00:13</strong></p>
<p>Bowser joke</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Today at 00:13</strong></p>
<p>bowser please we're having a socratic discussion</p>
<p>Sfhsjfjf</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 00:14</strong></p>
<p>(He's doing a reference, to a game from our world.)</p>
<p>In this game there's a man named Mario who must rescue a woman named Princess Peach, who is kidnapped by a turtle man named Bowser.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 00:14</strong></p>
<p>@Numbuh 362 I told you I know how to get in touch with Mario xD</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Today at 00:14</strong></p>
<p>so good quantifies how much one fulfills their purpose?</p>
<p><strong>Numbuh 362 — Today at 00:14</strong></p>
<p>I am Mario</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 00:14</strong></p>
<p>Wait wh-</p>
<p>OKAY back to how we define good.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:15</strong></p>
<p>Sure?</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Today at 00:15</strong></p>
<p>excuse that interruption</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 00:15</strong></p>
<p>So, question, if good is the fulfillment of ones essence, who defines what the essence of something is?</p>
<p>The maker, I'd assume?</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 00:17</strong></p>
<p>The god of that domain id guess? The god of 'cups' or 'holiding liquid' to go with our earlier example, of such a domain exists</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Today at 00:17</strong></p>
<p>also, there is an implicit assumption here that essence precedes existence, isn't there?</p>
<p>in other words, that the definition one ought to fulfill is set in stone and that they are born into it</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:17</strong></p>
<p>The definition is uncertain and so people attempt instead to emulate gods</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 00:17</strong></p>
<p>Yeah. I was wondering if the regular divine intervention that exists in that plane allows them to realize this definition of good far more better than we could.</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 00:17</strong></p>
<p>Ah, so do they align themselves towards a certain divine domain and mimic the gods of those domains?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:17</strong></p>
<p>By being close to their god in life they hope when they die they will be physically closer to their god in death, a perpetuity</p>
<p>Failure typical means going elsewhere.&nbsp; Far from one's god</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 00:18</strong></p>
<p>Okay, but what if one chooses to align themselves with no god? Do they just disappear when they die? Their souls I mean.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:19</strong></p>
<p>No</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Today at 00:19</strong></p>
<p>but if the definitions are uncertain, how can this system of good actually evaluate actions?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:20</strong></p>
<p>Those who don't wish to be judged by Qoseem in accordance with a particular faith find closeness with Malignus.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:20</strong></p>
<p>I'm not an expert on religious studies.&nbsp; In fact I'm a bad practitioner of my own faith.</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Today at 00:20</strong></p>
<p>that's understandable</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 00:20</strong></p>
<p>Slightly personal question if you don't mind, what god do you align yourself with?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:24</strong></p>
<p>I suppose that one is a little safer than my gender or department…</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Today at 00:24</strong></p>
<p>no pressure!!</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:24</strong></p>
<p>I worship Alligans god of contracts.</p>
<p>He resides near Ananakeia in the infernal perpetuity.</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 00:25</strong></p>
<p>Is Ananakeia in a separate ring?</p>
<p>Wait, yeah, pretty sure it'd be. Like seventh or ninth ring?</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 00:26</strong></p>
<p>God of Contracts?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:26</strong></p>
<p>Not the ninth</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 00:26</strong></p>
<p>Oh, yeah, sorry for interrupting.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:27</strong></p>
<p>Thats the other side.&nbsp; Not much is known about it</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 00:27</strong></p>
<p>Interesting, I have much to learn on the structure of the universe.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:27</strong></p>
<p>The first ring is where you and I are although my world is three plans in constant direct overlay</p>
<p>planes*</p>
<p>eight is the center of all things</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 00:28</strong></p>
<p>And it's all fine there? No wacky spontaneous plane warpings?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:28</strong></p>
<p>Actually... it happens often</p>
<p>The dead that escape Quoseem's extensions sometimes appear here.</p>
<p>We use the Shadow often though for certain spells and practice.</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 00:30</strong></p>
<p>So your plane has a direct overlap with Quoseem's plane? I assume he has a plane since you mention things escaping from Quoseem's extensions.</p>
<p>And what does Shadow mean? A medium for spellcasting?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:32</strong></p>
<p>No.. Qoseem exists in judgement</p>
<p>The Shadow, The Etherial, and the Material were all once one place if you believe that sort of thing.</p>
<p>Death was handled very differently back then apparently.</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 00:34</strong></p>
<p>So the Material, means planar? Aetherial means the aetherial matrix itself I'd take it, and is Shadow the aspect of... I'm not quite sure, but I imagine the afterlife? Somehow?</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 00:36</strong></p>
<p>I think peach means that the aetherial, material, and shadow are all planes that exist basically on top of each other?</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Today at 00:36</strong></p>
<p>maybe purgatory</p>
<p>aren't all planes material though?</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 00:37</strong></p>
<p>I can see that, like three-fold planar overlap. Although I thought the definition of a plane was a space vacated of aether fluid?</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Today at 00:37</strong></p>
<p>^</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:37</strong></p>
<p>The Aetherial is not the Etherial.&nbsp; Yet more confusing words</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Today at 00:37</strong></p>
<p>oh no</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 00:37</strong></p>
<p>Ah, sorry. Thought it was a typo.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:37</strong></p>
<p>Yet these have been commonly accepted terms for a long time</p>
<p>Culture needs to sort all that out eventually</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 00:39</strong></p>
<p>Figures. So is Shadow purgatory like was suggested? And that's a plane that overlaps with yours, allowing the dead to come through to your place?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:40</strong></p>
<p>I don't know what purgatory is</p>
<p>Sorry, didn't read all that</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 00:40</strong></p>
<p>Well, it's essentially the land of the dead.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:40</strong></p>
<p>Also not an expert in this...&nbsp; Shadow is the material but... different?</p>
<p>Ah</p>
<p>We call that Judgement</p>
<p>Where you await the ruling of Qoseem</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Today at 00:41</strong></p>
<p>yes, that's purgatory for us</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 00:41</strong></p>
<p>Ah, right, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Today at 00:41</strong></p>
<p>liminal space between life and afterlife</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 00:41</strong></p>
<p>Got confused on how we defined it.</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 00:43</strong></p>
<p>Would an expert in Planar studies be someone good to consult with on this?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:43</strong></p>
<p>Definitely</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 00:47</strong></p>
<p>WTF what did i miss?!</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 00:47</strong></p>
<p>Philosophy and gods and planes.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:47</strong></p>
<p>Apparently a conversation on ethics and the setup of my world</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 00:48</strong></p>
<p>Ooookkkkk</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 00:51</strong></p>
<p>how do you guys harvest this shadow?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:52</strong></p>
<p>Harvest?</p>
<p>It's a place.&nbsp; I don't understand</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 00:52</strong></p>
<p>oh, my bad, I have trouble following a conversation sometimes :joy:</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 00:53</strong></p>
<p>Is Shadow a part of Judgement? Or do some people get sorted there by Quoseem?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:53</strong></p>
<p>Shadow is a plane on the first ring that has a continuous overlay here.</p>
<p>I'll try to give a breakdown but I'm no expert</p>
<p>The shadow, etherial (not aether), and material exist within the first ring and have constant seemingly random overlays.&nbsp; The second ring is Oberidian and hosts the closest god to us with his extensions.&nbsp; The third hosts elemental planes which are essentially storage for elementals which keep our world mostly cleaned up if they are naturalized.</p>
<p>Note there are other planes within the rings but I don't really know many of them</p>
<p>Eight is the center, no idea what seven is, six is the perpetuities mostly, five judgement, four some other things.</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 00:57</strong></p>
<p>I see, so Shadow is just a drifting spooky world in the first ring? Like a plane full of monsters and ghouls that just drifts wherever?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:58</strong></p>
<p>Why would you assume that?</p>
<p>It's another place although I know little about it</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 00:59</strong></p>
<p>I thought you said monsters cross over from one of the planes that overlaps your world into your world.</p>
<p>Although now I recall, I shouldn't assume that plane is Shadow.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:59</strong></p>
<p>The dead sometimes cross over</p>
<p>Ghosts</p>
<p>and that is the Etherial</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 01:01</strong></p>
<p>Ohhhh. So the Etherial plane is the extension of Quoseem? And Shadow is, well you said you use it for spells.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:01</strong></p>
<p>The extensions are creatures</p>
<p>Beings</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 01:01</strong></p>
<p>Aye.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:01</strong></p>
<p>I shouldn't say creatures</p>
<p>They are entities with different functions but serve directly a god.&nbsp; With Qoseem they tend to guide the dead to Judgement</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 01:02</strong></p>
<p>Okay, I can see how that has me reinterpret what you said about the dead escaping.</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 01:03</strong></p>
<p>So extentions might be what wed call angels</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 01:03</strong></p>
<p>Or psychopomps, in the general term.</p>
<p>Given that psychopomps are literally guides for ghosts.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:03</strong></p>
<p>I'll need to do more research I suppose</p>
<p>Not every extension is a guide.</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 01:05</strong></p>
<p>Beings of a divine nature that serve a god. Qoseem's extensions sound like what we'd consider a grim reaper like entity to be, in function if not appearance. Guiding the dead to judgement</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 01:05</strong></p>
<p>Or perhaps whatever else function Qoseem deems fit.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:06</strong></p>
<p>Anything to spread their domain</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 01:06</strong></p>
<p>So you said that the dead escaping extensions of Qoseem, that's due to the three-fold planar overlap at your world, yeah? So I would assume that one of the planes in that planar overlap is your world, and another is one where Qoseem's extensions interact with the dead, from which the dead escape? What's the third plane that overlaps?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:07</strong></p>
<p>The Etherial is where they usually are.&nbsp; When one dies they often find themselves there to be claimed and guided by Qoseem's extensions</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Today at 01:12</strong></p>
<p>Someone in the main channel just asked an interesting question, are there people that work for multiple departments? Or is everyone limited to their own single department?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:13</strong></p>
<p>All singular department roles.</p>
<p>But, there are multi departmental obligations and studies</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Today at 01:13</strong></p>
<p>is there never a need for people with multiple specializations?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:14</strong></p>
<p>People cross specializations but we are only assigned to a single department.</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Today at 01:14</strong></p>
<p>I know necromancy seems to be working with everyone to allows visual communication between our world's, are there any more prominent cross-department projects going on</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:14</strong></p>
<p>Project Grindstone</p>
<p>But yeah, several</p>
<p>Although being assigned to one as an assistant is rare</p>
<p>When you become a researcher you might luck into field research if that is your thing.&nbsp; It certainly isn't for everyone.</p>
<p>And not many get the option</p>
