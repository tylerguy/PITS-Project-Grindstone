<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Yesterday at 23:57</strong></p>
<p>Yeah we're attempting to get another person, sounds like they found you</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:17</strong></p>
<p>I've been staring at this too long.&nbsp; I think it's your tun to try.</p>

<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 01:21</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for finding this! Have faith in us, we'll crack it in no time!</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:23</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, with this we won't be limited on intellegence we can gather due to code.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 01:29</strong></p>
<p>So much to catch up on. I forsee a lot of reading in my near future. Still, its good to be back</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 18:06</strong></p>
<p>Just to keep you up to date: We've been working on the cipher since last night. As this is clearly a Multi-Level Encryption, it's gonna take some time to crack. We think we've gotten past one level, but not much more than that.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 18:23</strong></p>
<p>Is there anything else you can learn about this transmission that might clue us in. I'm sure we're missing something, but we've tried a TON of decryption methods, and found nothing.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:38</strong></p>
<p>The message is only the end of a message.&nbsp; As for what I know about the encrption, I know it was created during the revolution by The Headmaster himself before he was ever The Headmaster.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 18:39</strong></p>
<p>What's the Headmaster's Name, by chance?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:46</strong></p>
<p>No one calls him by his name anymore but it's Samuel Ehrenhaft Schreiber.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 18:49</strong></p>
<p>Did he go by any other nicknames, besides Headmaster now? If he invented this encryption method, he likely named it something based on himself, so any info on him might point us in the right direction.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 19:04</strong></p>
<p>The Headmaster is his title.&nbsp; He doesn't have any nicknames as far as I know.&nbsp; He is a masterclass cryptologist, mathmatician, and aetherial specialist.&nbsp; A real polymath and polyglot.&nbsp; He has in recent years not been very visible to the public or within the walls of UMAD however.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 19:52</strong></p>
<p>Any other questions?</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 19:53</strong></p>
<p>Weird question, does your alphabet have 26 basic characters? Like ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 23:12</strong></p>
<p>We have alphanumeric characters but they often differ regionally.&nbsp; The script type I've adopted is common with communication these intervals and it seems that you also use it which is strange but convienent.&nbsp; With that said, not every form of communication is efficiently provided by distance communication in this way.&nbsp; In fact it takes several additional steps to use simple characters like these.</p>
<p>There are several standard character methods of communication that exist.&nbsp; Some are entirely numerical.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 23:19</strong></p>
<p>Ok, now that gets my attention. So far, the one aspect of the Cipher we've been able to crack has lead to nothing but a series of Numbers, but we haven't gotten further than that.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 23:24</strong></p>
<p>I'm glad I might be able to point you in the right direction.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 23:44</strong></p>
<p>Seems UMAD is making their move. I assume you see what is going on in the Main Chat?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 23:47</strong></p>
<p>Random is inefficient and can lead to a waste of UMAD resources.&nbsp; I don't trust it was random selection.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 23:48</strong></p>
<p>Then who else did they contact, and why? As far as I know, none of us got that message.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 23:49</strong></p>
<p>I've started outlining what I'll need for new equipment to make my communication more efficient for everyone.&nbsp; Some of these items are going to be difficult to find without being suspicious.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Who knows?&nbsp; Did this person put something on the google that would make them suspicious?&nbsp; Did they say something strange in chat ever?&nbsp; Sometimes the littlest things set off UMAD.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 23:50</strong></p>
<p>Don't take too big a risk. We're able to communicate fine for now, so only make changes if you feel it's safe. With UMAD on the move again, we can't afford to be careless</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 23:51</strong></p>
<p>They have waited so long for a second mission...&nbsp; This is very unusual.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 23:53</strong></p>
<p>We're suspecting they're trying to draw you out, since they have no clue the rest of us are involved. It's especially telling that the person posting this has barely been active in the main chat until this moment. Why them? That's a red flag to me.</p>
<p>Or perhaps this "Leslie" is one of them in disguise. Might be looking for others to help keep an eye out for people like us.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 23:56</strong></p>
<p>UMAD values loyalty.&nbsp; The most common saying in UMAD is "Need to know" while the second is "Compliance will be rewarded".&nbsp; The latter is typically heard by the employee groups outside of research, war prisoners, or those wanting a second chance at life that have been locked away.</p>
<p>Although the criminal elelment is not always willing...&nbsp; Usually it's the idea of family members acting as surrogates in their incarceration trying to pay off old debts, usually legal debts from the publuic cases.</p>
<p>Many people are trying to push against such action but who really wants to represent the criminal element in a country trying to rebuild itself after wartime?</p>
