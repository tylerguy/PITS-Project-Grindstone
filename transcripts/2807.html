<p><strong>Peach — Today at 1:12 PM</strong></p>
<p>Hello everyone, I'm back.&nbsp; No one else seems to have found my peach file yet.&nbsp; Ah well.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 1:25 PM</strong></p>
<p>On to your first question.&nbsp; First of all I stated they are not what they appear to be not that they are not who they say they are.&nbsp; They very much live up to their mission statement but given the authority permitted to them it doesn't take much time for alternative interests to build especially when operating with extra planar time dilations.&nbsp; I'm a researcher within UMAD and my time here has led me to seeing very concerning activities.&nbsp; It's unusual also for UMAD to consider so many foreign nationals for recruitment at one time as it would be a risk for national security yet there are several dozen of you in the application pool.&nbsp; I suspect what they are doing will be occurring soon.&nbsp; It's my hope that if you were able to find me that you will be able to assist with untangling a few things for me while also trying establish trust and gain acceptance into UMAD.&nbsp; Cross departmental insight might lead to a better understanding.</p>
<p>You can use this channel to keep away from the eyes of UMAD management and to perform cross department information exchange once accepted into a department.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 1:29 PM</strong></p>
<p>Cross departmental insight? So something like trying to find out more about the goings on between the cultural and necromancy department?</p>
<p>We were thinking earlier that the necromancy department seemed suspicious, Pauchik was the one who took down your clue after all</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 1:29 PM</strong></p>
<p>As for the nefarious "what they are doing" I have my suspicions but in an effort to avoid a slander case, which really is a fate worse than being tried with treason, I'd like to confirm my suspicions first.&nbsp; After all, we just met.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 1:34 PM</strong></p>
<p>Wait, "extra planar time dilation"? We're dealing with Potential Time Manipulation here? Yeah, I could see that leading to some Alternate Motives.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 1:35 PM</strong></p>
<p>Culture, Necromancy, Aetherial Study, Planar, Engineering, Alchemy, Infernal Affairs, Accounting, Administration, and Human Resources.&nbsp; Although the latter four are not research departments.&nbsp; When it comes to anyone with authority I think we can write Pauchik off as he is too... Pauchik.&nbsp; He assists with Qosomite divination technologies, communications program repair and insight.&nbsp; He also assists with the occasional construct programming but in all he is a Val whose mind seems to wander much too often.&nbsp; He is also a little gullible and easily scared.</p>
<p>Time manipulation in one direction.&nbsp; Not even gods can turn back the clocks.&nbsp; With Infernal Affairs they could easily utilize Perpetuities of some of the latter rings to make extra time for themselves.&nbsp; In fact we often do during research to make certain deadlines.&nbsp; Alchemy will often collaborate with Planar to see lengthy reactions occur within a reasonable time for instance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 1:40 PM</strong></p>
<p>Wow Deep Stuff. I assumed it wasn't full time control, but even simply slowing down time could have some Massive implications, especially when combined with the other Research being done.</p>
<p>Still, while I don't think we need to consider Pauchik a problem, we should still keep our eyes open. If there is one thing I've learned in my time, it's that ignoring someone like that is never a good idea. With the kind of research UMAD is working on, one bad day with him could lead to some serious issues. Better we work to keep him stable, and possibly make him an Ally. That kind of eccentricity could be beneficial if channeled correctly.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 1:41 PM</strong></p>
<p>If you say so, just try not to get locked into a conversation about his hobbies.&nbsp; Val voices already are hard to listen to and that man can talk.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 1:43 PM</strong></p>
<p>I don't doubt that. Most of us are Geeks ourselves about different hobbies, so we all know what we can be like when given the chance to talk about our favorite topic. We'll be careful about that.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 1:45 PM</strong></p>
<p>Absolutely, I especially love to see someone so passionate about their work and hobbies.&nbsp; It's just the screeching...</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 1:47 PM</strong></p>
<p>So are there any Members of the UMAD staff we SHOULD be worried about? Who's likely our biggest problem here?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 1:51 PM</strong></p>
<p>Well, Janet is much more informed than most people and she reports directly to the Assistant Headmaster but I never see her leave her desk...ever.&nbsp; Day or night when I come in she is still there, the first face you see.&nbsp; She communicates directly with all the departments and seems to be the first to reprimand those who fall out of the dense rules and regulations.&nbsp; She is also the decision maker for who continues on during the recruitment process.&nbsp; She is not the final say in hiring but she has the final say in who makes it to the last stage of the selection process.&nbsp; I've seen her terminate applicants without seemingly any cause.&nbsp; When approached she simply provides the UMAD standard answer for nearly everything "Need to Know".&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then there is anyone in charge of making the decision for declaring the department head of the Planar department.&nbsp; It seems every week we have a new head and it's hardly ever addressed.&nbsp; They disappear, are in accidents, become plane touched, and all sorts of things.&nbsp; Some just aren't talked about.&nbsp; It's like a position made to get rid of problematic people.&nbsp; Luckily you're foreign nationals and so you'll never be promoted to a department head position.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 1:55 PM</strong></p>
<p>Hence your Code Word to get your attention...</p>
<p>So she's one of those types. Yeah, I can see her being an issue. We're gonna have to play nice with her until we get the answers we need. But with the Department Heads being a Revolving Door, that could prove troublesome, as we'll need to learn how to talk with each of them, and some might just be unapproachable. Fun times...</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 1:55 PM</strong></p>
<p>Engineering has been without a department head for some time but that department is all sorts of mucked up.&nbsp; They still keep Meer Soot on staff for whatever reason and assignments aren't assigned by a direct supervisor, they are just handed out on letters.&nbsp; Letters often for "your eyes or alternative visual sensory data processing organ or system only".</p>
<p>Playing nice with Janet won't get you far, it'll just get you anywhere.&nbsp; Lot's of us kiss her feet for the chance to make appointments, get special assignments, all sorts of things.&nbsp; She is one tough Rau.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 1:58 PM</strong></p>
<p>"alternative visual sensory data processing organ or system" so I'm assuming we have some Cybernetics involved here?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 1:58 PM</strong></p>
<p>No one is even certain where she comes from.&nbsp; According to her papers she is a national but her credentials seem inflated to me.</p>
<p>I'm not certain what cybernetics are but some see from alternatives grafts or process visual information in a way that is not the same as "seeing" something.&nbsp; It's hard to understand the simulation of reality for some entities but that is one thing Alchemy and necromancy intersect on quite a bit.&nbsp; There has even been talk of creating a Medical Studies department for proper biological investigations.&nbsp; I shudder at the acquisition measures.&nbsp; We already use many unfortunates and chill in experimentations.</p>
<p>For your viewing pleasure.&nbsp; Pauchik's hobby.&nbsp; Please note this isn't his work but a good example of what he does.</p>

<p><br><strong>TheShades — Today at 2:05 PM</strong></p>
<p>OH DEAR GOD! If this is the kind of stuff he's doing, I shudder to think where that could lead. Now I see why we should avoid talking about his hobbies. I don't think I could stomach the real deal</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 19:15</strong></p>
<p>Well, now we know not to get on Pauchik's bad side at least</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 19:16</strong></p>
<p>I've only seen him angry once.&nbsp; Generally he is one of the happiest researchers I know.&nbsp; Very well adjusted.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 19:17</strong></p>
<p>That's good to hear. Let's hope we can keep it that way</p>
<p>Let's look at other aspects of this. Why would UMAD want to bring in people from all over. I can see not wanting to be TOO local for risk of being discovered, but why such a Broad Net? What is their goal with that?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 19:26</strong></p>
<p>Excellent question.&nbsp; There are so many possible answers but the one commonality you all have in the discord with the exception of the established members there is that you are foreign nationals.&nbsp; I think with how they cast their net they may intend a much larger recruitment drive in the future.&nbsp; A referral by an established member of UMAD and not a recruitment officer can expedite the admissions process but those who are typically have a lower clearance level than those who earned their right the hard way.&nbsp; If they are casting a net over a large area then they might be casting a net for a large catch.&nbsp; If that's so however I wonder why so many.&nbsp; I suppose recruitment numbers have been low for some time and our staffing is... depleting slowly.</p>
<p>Maybe it's the new field project…</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 19:29</strong></p>
<p>New field project?</p>
<p>I guess it must be a pretty big project to warrant this many people. What have you heard about it?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 19:34</strong></p>
<p>Project Grindstone.&nbsp; All I know is it's interdepartmental and the listed project supervisor is redacted.&nbsp; It could be anyone's project.&nbsp; Ever since it was announced people have been strange around the tower.&nbsp; I suspect that many of us are working on it in secret.&nbsp; I feel like it's fostering more suspicion in the workplace however.&nbsp; Not very productive.</p>
<p>Is there any other questions so far?&nbsp; About anything really.&nbsp; At current I'm attempting to access some redacted documents filed under a hire clearance than myself.&nbsp; The difficulty is, it seems the higher ups use a cipher to communicate that I'm not familiar with.&nbsp; My hope is to intercept an air elemental to acquire a sample of it.&nbsp; Using this sample I'll need to find a solution and be provided an explanation on how to solve it.&nbsp; Once I have that I should be able to decipher correspondences on a more secure level.&nbsp; I'm hoping that the new information I can listen in on will provide insight on what might be going on or maybe help me find a way to access those documents.&nbsp; It might just be hopeful thinking but I'm not certain what other direction to take.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 19:42</strong></p>
<p>Why not ask us to help. The Fact we're here now shows we know a thing or two about cracking ciphers. At the very least, I've been good at Identifying what the Cipher is, which points others in the right direction. I bet with even just the three of us together, we'd have a good shot at it.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 19:45</strong></p>
<p>We're happy to give it a go, once I've been clued in on what kind of cipher it can be I'm pretty good at throwing a load of potential solutions at it until I get something coherent.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 19:45</strong></p>
<p>I think that's a good idea.&nbsp; I'll set out an aetherial net to collect correspondence from an air elemental.&nbsp; Once I have the sample I can send it to you.&nbsp; I'll still dig around and maybe get some other work for you while you work on that cipher.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another concern I have is there are only three of you.&nbsp; I was hoping there would be maybe a few more who could find me...&nbsp; Working between departments may be tricky if there aren't enough of us to investigate every department.&nbsp; Doing what I did with the last email however was very risky.&nbsp; I really can't put myself out there anymore.</p>
<p>I did notice you were getting help elsewhere TheShades.&nbsp; Collaboration might be important but having more people I can directly contact could be just as helpful.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 19:49</strong></p>
<p>We've actually been talking amongst ourselves (So as not to clutter this chat), and we've considered reaching out to a few others who we know could help from the main chat, without saying anything publicly.</p>
<p>Hell, We could even use that little slip up you just did of going in the Voice Chat as a starting point :stuck_out_tongue:</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 19:50</strong></p>
<p>Yeah... I do that a lot.&nbsp; Just be careful how you go about it.&nbsp; To clarify how I saw you looking for help, it was a "reddit" about three weeks ago I think?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 19:51</strong></p>
<p>Ahh yes, the Game theorists. MatPat has made his own ARGs, after having worked to solve so many, so if there is any group of people who could help, it'd be them. It's a matter of how to bring them in here without UMAD seein it</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 19:51</strong></p>
<p>A little off topic but im trying to catch up. I noticed a few words dont seem to translate well. Things like Rau and Val. What are those?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 19:52</strong></p>
<p>Also a "terranova2552" looking for help but I'm not certain who that might be.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 19:52</strong></p>
<p>Not familiar with that name, but i'll look into it</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 19:53</strong></p>
<p>If your recruitment process was anything like mine they will allow you to invite additional assistance with each stage of your application.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 19:54</strong></p>
<p>Getting them into the Main Channel may not prove too difficult. It's more about getting them to you is the issue. Thankfully, I might have a slim chance to contact Matpat himself, since I used to work with him in his very early days. Let me see what I can do with that.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 19:55</strong></p>
<p>You are extraplanar so I suppose you don't have Rau or Val.&nbsp; Maybe you call them something else?&nbsp; I'd send picture examples if I had them.&nbsp; Unfortunately images I send from where I am just become a garbled mess before it even goes to send.&nbsp; I can access images from your Qosomite system however.&nbsp; "Google" is the channel I frequent.</p>
<p>UMAD however seems to have access to an ability to communicate clearly AND send images.&nbsp; Maybe I can find a way eventually.&nbsp; The key will be doing it safely.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 20:00</strong></p>
<p>I do know a couple of people on this server already who are quite good at codebreaking and might be able to help us out, and I've also been checking to see who's been looking for extra clues around Project Grindstone, inspecting source code and things like that.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:01</strong></p>
<p>Val are something like this except... different.&nbsp; I'm not sure how this creature is gripping anything.&nbsp; He looks like a child Val but an adult?&nbsp; Although I couldn't designate an origin to this one like other Val either.</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:433px;"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/D3htuvI9FRdF7WgpVikdy5unOSZGqrqFIdOAprxKG_S0w0gjeW0kGiJyw_7IsC9lVmF1mK8BmNU79xXlzEHoBSR3aqS8yPQa2c_dLnOuwGS4AC6859vINmdaViT4XMDOvS2myKDP"></figure>
<p>Might be useful.&nbsp; The application process will only get more difficult and we need people who can ascend through the ranks within UMAD and gain their trust.&nbsp; I'm not sure how they are handling the physical for you come to think of it...</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 20:08</strong></p>
<p>Huh, interesting. Honestly I don't know how it's gripping anything either, those limbs are not supposed to work like that.</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 20:09</strong></p>
<p>Im more interested in the message that appeared for a sec. One of your 'wallflower artifacts' seemed to poke in.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 20:10</strong></p>
<p>You mentioned something called Qosomite, and that you go to "channels" on it, including Google. Is it something similar to what we'd call the internet?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:18</strong></p>
<p>Qosomite?&nbsp; It means having to do with Qoseem.&nbsp; God of communication, death, efficiency?&nbsp; Any system of aetherial programming meant for communication is called a Qosomite system.&nbsp; It's a little on the nose but it works for explaining what it does.&nbsp; Currently I'm utilizing a constant aetherial draw with tertiary input for purpose of a conceptual link to extraplanar but time adjacent communication.&nbsp; In a way my messages are being fed in part way through a circuit that your people have developed to allow for me to communicate with you.&nbsp; It's not perfect as you can see however.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This system is very impractical but necessary given our situation.&nbsp; I just hope that the constant summation does not make me too conspicuous.&nbsp; I try to change my draw point without changing the point of aeonization to keep my location private however.</p>
<p>I do have to re-establish the programing each time which can be daunting but I've gotten pretty quick at it.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:22</strong></p>
<p>Explains the fact we have to Decode all your messages. Seems to be a form of what we call "Technomagic", since you're using aetherial lines to connect with our Earth-Based Technology</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 20:22</strong></p>
<p>Sounds like a magical vpn if im understanding it right</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 20:23</strong></p>
<p>We can decode it quite easily, and if you're doing what you can to keep yourself safe then this should still be fine. Whatever works works, right?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:24</strong></p>
<p>Technomagic?&nbsp; Do you mean Construct Crafting?&nbsp; It's an intersection for programmers who graduated beyond simple necromancy and most alchemists.&nbsp; Animated objects that are both material and aetherial in structure through three to five dimensional programming.</p>
<p>I'm not certain what a vpn is but I'll likely use the google channel for many things after our conversation.&nbsp; It's been very informative.</p>
<p>This sounds very dangerous.&nbsp; Does everyone have easy access?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:30</strong></p>
<p>Pretty much. There are Restrictions on what we can access, of course, but it's since become a tool we use in our daily lives. We even been able to make it portable, able to carry devices that can access it from anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:31</strong></p>
<p>That's not very UMAD at all!&nbsp; Exciting in many ways but UMAD originated as an intelligence group during the Ramean Revolution and they are not the quickest or most willing to disperse some information.&nbsp; Maybe this Google has something to do with what they are doing?</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 20:31</strong></p>
<p>A lot of people do, a lot of the population does not. In regards to wealth distribution you need to be born in one of the more rich countries to have access to the Internet, and even then it's not guaranteed. It's been a very useful tool for a lot of us, for better and for worse</p>
<p>.</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 20:33</strong></p>
<p>More or less. Nearly everyone can use the 'qosomite system' as you put it. We essentially have a library of most of the worlds&nbsp; knowledge at our fingertips. But there's a lot garbage to sort through too. Definitely has its pros and cons.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:33</strong></p>
<p>Them using Google is risky for them. It would be very easy for some of us to hack into their systems if they were not aware of any vunerabilities in their constructs, and then all their secrets could be leaked. It happens quite often here, sadly.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:34</strong></p>
<p>This makes a lot more sense to me.&nbsp; Of course the wealthy would have access to the google.&nbsp; I'm not once to talk, I had much privilege growing up.&nbsp; It was my upbringing that gave me the tools necessary to successfully apply to UMAD in the end however.&nbsp; Originally I thought I would be trained in a different art but I'm glad I could get more formal training in this specialty later in life.</p>
<p>UMAD would not be so shortsighted.&nbsp; So maybe it isn't the google.</p>
<p>But I suppose I've been that short sighted...</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:36</strong></p>
<p>Still, if they're using our Internet in anyway, there's a chance there could be a backdoor they are not aware of. It's just a matter of finding it before they do</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 20:39</strong></p>
<p>Are... are we thinking about hacking an interdimensional magical government agency/research academy?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:41</strong></p>
<p>But I suppd�v���B6W'F��v�B�6���r�2'WBF�B6�V�G2�&amp;�F��W2�T�B�2fW'�F�vW&amp;�W2W7V6��ǒ6��6R�B�2�V�&amp;W"�bv�fW&amp;��V�B&amp;��V7G2��7W�6R��R6�wB&amp;RG&amp;�VBf�"G&amp;V6��2f�&amp;V�v��F������vWfW#�se I've been that short sighted…</p>
<p>[Garbled bit when solved] I'm not certain what hacking is but that sounds ambitious.&nbsp; UMAD is very dangerous especially since it has a number of government projects.&nbsp; I suppose you ca n't be tried for treason as a foreign national however?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:43</strong></p>
<p>ummm... Kind of breaking up there. That one seems kind of Garbled.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:43</strong></p>
<p>Likely interference.&nbsp; I'll need to readjust my system in about 20 ticks.&nbsp; I'm not sure how long that'll take.&nbsp; Feel free to ask any questions at all however.</p>
<p>I encourage you to lead others you trust to me so we can expand our numbers a bit.&nbsp; After I head off I'll let you know when I'm back.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 20:46</strong></p>
<p>Thanks for the info, best of luck with the... technical difficulties? Arcane difficulties?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:47</strong></p>
<p>There is nothing arcane with my systems.&nbsp; These are all very new magics.</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 20:47</strong></p>
<p>Youre leaving in 20 ticks? Whats a tick?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:48</strong></p>
<p>About 10 breaths?</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 20:50</strong></p>
<p>Seems you have different measurements of time than we do.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:50</strong></p>

<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 20:51</strong></p>
<p>Well that depends on the size of your lungs</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 20:51</strong></p>
<p>What are these?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:52</strong></p>
<p>I'm trying to find a way to describe Rau to you.&nbsp; They have horns and an aposematism.&nbsp; They vary in shapes and sizes also horn coloration and appearance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Judging by your "digital clock" I found a tick is about a minute, maybe a little off?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 20:54</strong></p>
<p>So they look like devils with skin markings?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:56</strong></p>
<p>Some think they are infernal but there is no historical or biological evidence to this.&nbsp; Only past tensions by Helshian and those who came to found Victoria.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>It looks like it's my time to go but I'll be back.&nbsp; Any question you leave here I will answer when I'm back.</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 20:58</strong></p>
<p>Stay safe.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 23:02</strong></p>
<p>I'm back.</p>
<p>Didn't mean to directly message you there Chuck.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Yesterday at 23:04</strong></p>
<p>It's no problem</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 23:12</strong></p>
<p>Looks like some of the existing researchers might be getting involved in your next admissions mission.&nbsp; Mission two is what we call the aptitude examination.&nbsp; For me it was a bunch of questions but for you all it seems as though it will be something different.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Yesterday at 23:13</strong></p>
<p>Any idea what it could be or who the researchers involved might be?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 23:16</strong></p>
<p>Not sure but I have a few guesses.&nbsp; Looking around on the google I confirmed a couple researchers on Project Grindstone and they happen to be from your plane.&nbsp; Strange how easy it was to find on your end.&nbsp; I haven't confirmed a single researcher on our end yet.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Yesterday at 23:17</strong></p>
<p>Any names of the researchers on our end?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 23:19</strong></p>
<p>I also confirmed researched Hyles and researcher Marino at this time.&nbsp; All three are the same situation.Researcher March I was surprised to find was one of you.&nbsp; Although that makes sense as I've never seen her in person.&nbsp; Also I tried to pull up her personnel file and it seems to be missing from files I can access with my clearance.</p>
<p>I suspect there are many more of you.&nbsp; UMAD is a big place so it didn't seem strange to go without seeing certain researchers but now I might look into this closer.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Yesterday at 23:24</strong></p>
<p>Huh, Hyles I already knew about from a Twitter post, that's who I found this out from. Do not know about March and Marino.</p>
<p>We might have to do some snooping to see if they've said anything about Grindstone</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 23:40</strong></p>
<p>Also there is a researcher Freeman that is from your side.&nbsp; I just confirmed.</p>
