<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:00</strong></p>
<p>Possible that Leslie is but what do they gain by presenting this information?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 00:01</strong></p>
<p>Best Guess: Given they know someone like you is out there. They may be trying to see if someone will say something to tip them off. I bet if one of us asked why we didn't get one, they'd start questioning us.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:09</strong></p>
<p>As long as we keep safe we have a team now that can investigate each of the departments at least.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 00:13</strong></p>
<p>And clearly, we're smart enough to not fall for an obvious trap. We've been talking in Private while working on the Cipher, and I can say I'm confident our team can pull this off. It's just a matter of cracking these codes.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 00:40</strong></p>
<p>We have another Singer joining the Server, Cami-Cat. We brought her up before, so I suspect she's another researcher.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 00:41</strong></p>
<p>Speaking of, Peach I think I might have an idea who the mysterious Researcher Orange might be</p>
<p>I know you mentioned that you'd need higher clearance to be sure but I might as well say the name so that in case he pops up anywhere you can let us know. They go by The Stupendium online? He's worked with Cami-Cat a few times and has a bit of an orange motif around the icons they use, in particular his channel logo</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 01:29</strong></p>
<p>Hey peach I got a message from UMAD management</p>

<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 01:30</strong></p>
<p>Just like that other person</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 01:35</strong></p>
<p>@Peach We think we got it. Took some work, and had to research a bit, but here's what we got: We reversed the Code, then used what we call "Base64" to decode it into numbers. Then we treated one number, 76, as a Space, and ran it through another Cipher, called a homophonic cipher, and while it's not perfect, we got this:</p>

<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:16</strong></p>
<p>The text seems to mostly make sense?&nbsp; I think I can work with that however.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 02:16</strong></p>
<p>I'm working on cleaning it up a bit more so we get a fuller picture</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:17</strong></p>
<p>There's also a very odd thing. One of those Names is VERY Familiar: John Tague.</p>
<p>Simply put: That's MY name. Had a bit to talk about with that one.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:17</strong></p>
<p>Snow, it looks like UMAD is getting a bit more aggressive.&nbsp; It must be getting to them..&nbsp; my email that is.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:18</strong></p>
<p>If you hadn't mentioned this was from the Revolution, I'd be looking very suspicious right now</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:18</strong></p>
<p>Oh Dear...</p>
<p>It's not from the revolution.&nbsp; The code was developed during that time.&nbsp; I intercepted that message only a few intervals ago.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:19</strong></p>
<p>There are more than a Few John Tagues out there, so it's not too worrysome, but that is one hell of a coincidence.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:20</strong></p>
<p>If you say so...</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:20</strong></p>
<p>While I can't prove my innocence with this, I can ask you to give me a chance to prove myself, so I can earn your trust, cause I know I'm not in the best of lights right now</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:22</strong></p>
<p>You were the one to solve the message.&nbsp; What is everyone else's thoughts?&nbsp; I think it's likely you are involved somehow or are in danger and therfore involved somehow...&nbsp; Or it's all a very eerie coincidence.</p>
<p>I'll look into this The Stupendium a little closer...</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 02:24</strong></p>
<p>It's certainly weird, I'm piecing the cipher together and it looks like it might be "John Tague of Reddit" so it's likely they just found a reddit post by someone by the name of John Tague, which again could be anyone</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:24</strong></p>
<p>Regardless the Cipher seems at least mostly correct...&nbsp; This will be very good for us.&nbsp; I'll be able to start gathering information from correspondences between dpartment heads.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:25</strong></p>
<p>Glad to know we could help. This was a good test on what we could do, so now we see what other challenges come next. We'll get to the bottom of this soon.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:27</strong></p>
<p>I'm going to put my project of improving communication aside and begin getting what information I can from department correspondences.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:28</strong></p>
<p>Good Idea. We've actually found a way to further streamline translating your messages, so we can easily afford to keep things the way they are. Focus on the bigger priority for now</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:34</strong></p>
<p>Can you show me where I can find more information on this cipher type?</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 02:35</strong></p>
<p>We used this, I'm trying to wrangle the plaintext into something more coherent and I'm making steady progress <a href="https://www.dcode.fr/homophonic-cipher"><u>https://www.dcode.fr/homophonic-cipher</u></a></p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:36</strong></p>
<p>You can also find the Base64 Decoder there as well.</p>
<p>We also used this to Reverse the text: <a href="http://spellbackwards.com/"><u>http://spellbackwards.com/</u></a></p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:44</strong></p>
<p>Base64 is a kind of encoding format. In fact, it's what your messages appear to us as, only in reverse, hence the other site I suggested.</p>
<p>@ChuckMorris You tested the Homophonic Cipher, didn't you? Can you explain it? I'm not as versed in it.</p>
<p><span class="text-big"><mark class="pen-red"><strong>[Translation shenanigans begin]</strong></mark></span></p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:45</strong></p>
<p>Maybe I should try converting it through this tool?</p>
<p>Is this better?</p>
<p>I forgot to reverse it.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 02:46</strong></p>
<p>It's essentially works as a substitution table, you can group multiple numbers to one letter and end up being able to encrypt in different combinations</p>
<p>For example if you write ABC and A could be encrypted as 1, 2, 3; B could be encrypted as 4, 5, 6; C can be encrypted as 7, 8, 9 etc, then you can write ABC as 147 or 359 or anything like that</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:47</strong></p>
<p>I see, is there a key?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:48</strong></p>
<p>It's just a matter of figuruing out the pattern.</p>
<p>Also, I think you're using the Base64 page wrong. You're accidently Double-Coding your Messages. I just figured out why I couldn't translate it at first</p>
<p>Here, for translating your messages, we've found a more streamline method: <a href="https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#recipe=Reverse(%27Character%27)From_Base64(%27A-Za-z0-9%2B/%3D%27,true)"><u>https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#recipe=Reverse(%27Character%27)From_Base64(%27A-Za-z0-9%2B/%3D%27,true)</u></a></p>
<p>Just put your message in the "Input" box, and it will put the translated text in the "Output" box</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:52</strong></p>
<p>testing</p>
<p>Does this read any better?</p>
<p>How about now?</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 02:55</strong></p>
<p>That's nearly perfect, just reverse it one more time</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:55</strong></p>
<p>This seems tedious.&nbsp; let me know if it's helping.</p>
<p>Now?</p>
<p><span class="text-big"><mark class="pen-red"><strong>[Translation shenanigans end]</strong></mark></span></p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 02:55</strong></p>
<p>That's perfect</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:55</strong></p>
<p>Hey! That did the trick!</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:55</strong></p>
<p>Seems like a lot.</p>
<p>You did this every time?</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 02:56</strong></p>
<p>Yup</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:56</strong></p>
<p>Once we figured it out, we were able to streamline the process, so all we had to do was Copy and Paste the code, and we'd have the translation.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:56</strong></p>
<p>It'll last until I need to reconnect.&nbsp; Hopefully that isn't for awhile...</p>
<p>At least I have a process now.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:57</strong></p>
<p>If that happens, and it changes, we can figure it out, and tell you quickly how to adapt</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:58</strong></p>
<p>It seems that the homophonic cipher has an exact key.&nbsp; Once I have that I can use it on my tricky quill to translate the cipher to real speak.&nbsp; After that we just have to wait until I find something relevant.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:58</strong></p>
<p>Either way, that's a win for the PITS!</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 03:01</strong></p>
<p>Infernal affairs has a process for acquiring new clearance certificates should a previous one be damaged or lost.&nbsp; It does bill to your employee account but the documents necessary for higher clearance levels don't exactly have a public way of being acquired.&nbsp; It also is not certain who has what clearance level within the heads of the departments.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 03:03</strong></p>
<p>I'm sure we'll figure that out soon enough. We now have the means to learn about a lot of new things regarding UMAD and their operations.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 03:03</strong></p>
<p>My thought is if I can gain insight onto the communication between departments maybe I can learn about these clearance documents.&nbsp; The issue is it will soon be known if a department head applies for a replacement.</p>
<p>True</p>
<p>Once you have a full key for characters send it to me.</p>
<p>I'll then program my tricky quill and it'll only be a matter of time.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 03:04</strong></p>
<p>We're quite close, we only have a few more characters to enter</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 03:25</strong></p>
<p>Tricky quill? Is that how you communicate?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 03:26</strong></p>
<p>They are just efficient.&nbsp; Aetherial multi-dimensional structures overlapping a material object, a quill in this case, that has basic command words.&nbsp; Very good for taking notes.</p>
<p>You can have them record on parchment other people however if you get good at programming them.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 03:27</strong></p>
<p>Fascinating</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 03:28</strong></p>
<p>I'll have them listen in on a few of the department heads or people of interest.&nbsp; Just need to decide on who first.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 04:03</strong></p>
<p>Ok we seem to have organised this a bit more, we've ended up with this:&nbsp;</p>
<p>WHICH IS TO BE EXPECTED. FROM HERE ON OUT, PLEASE ADHERE TO THE RENEWED GUIDELINES WHICH ARE OUTLINED IN THE MEMORANDUMS HANDED OUT LAST AUVAL.</p>
<p>THE FOLLOWING RESOURCES AND COMPONENTS ARE REQUIRED, FOR RESEARCH AND EXPERIMENTATION.</p>
<p>ONE LIVE ROTTWEILER</p>
<p>THREE LIVE CHILDREN, SPECIES IRRELEVANT. DESCRIPTOR: CUTE.</p>
<p>TWELVE LIVE “SILK” WORMS. NO SILK.</p>
<p>ONE LIVE EXTRAPLANAR AETHEREAL CONSTRUCT “BOOMBOX”, BRAND IRRELEVANT.</p>
<p>ONE LIVE “TWEET”. THEY ARE DESCRIBED AS POPULAR AND PROLIFIC.</p>
<p>ONE LIVE JOHN TAGUE, OF “REDDIT”. DESCRIPTOR: CULTURAL EXPERT. ALIAS, THESHADES</p>
<p>PLEASE REMEMBER THAT UNDER THE RENEWED GUIDELINES, MATERIALS ARE TO BE BROUGHT IN WORKING CONDITION. THIS INCLUDES BIOLOGICAL SPECIMENS.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 04:04</strong></p>
<p>Interesting. What is an Auval?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:04</strong></p>
<p>It's one of nine intervals.</p>
<p>Like Belval.</p>
<p>It's about 30 part.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 04:06</strong></p>
<p>Interesting</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:07</strong></p>
<p>Is there another John Tague who is TheShades?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 04:08</strong></p>
<p>That's doubtful. So now I'm no longer a Suspect... I'm a Target</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 04:08</strong></p>
<p>As far as I know, there's only the one</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:08</strong></p>
<p>I don't really think that is a victory for you.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 04:09</strong></p>
<p>Why do they want Shades though? Surely there are other Vtubers they could use</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:09</strong></p>
<p>Maybe they suspect him of something?&nbsp; Maybe it's his involvement on "Reddit"?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 04:10</strong></p>
<p>Here's the Key we used to decipher this thing:</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:219px;"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/qy2_EA5K0wCIWsi2TKVbRd5jVu-FyGJgWPtzVRbDjZeDa3c4d4lopHstJh-5jnxdnSObfeZ8DDTFaNaU1hobuPaTkdFa5_aQCu4n-p-Ub0jjMTyuU1CAr4nj0UCB89IsohSmpxLe"></figure>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:10</strong></p>
<p>Maybe it's just because he is here?</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 04:10</strong></p>
<p>:calebh4HM:</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 04:11</strong></p>
<p>But they found me on Reddit, and that's not even my home, AND they got my Real Name. It's not exactly hidden, but they had to dig a little to find that info. Why go through all that for me</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 04:11</strong></p>
<p>In which case, they may know about the rest of us as well. We should probably stay cautious</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:11</strong></p>
<p>Excellent.&nbsp; It shouldn't take me long to get the quills ready.&nbsp; Maybe I should have them copy Admin correspondences?&nbsp; Although Necromancy or Culture seem useful.</p>
<p>I mean no offense when I say this especially due to the nature of information retrieval assignments.&nbsp; If we are compromised the message doesn't look the best for you.</p>
<p>Just be careful and... don't take any deals with them.</p>
<p>On the other hand, maybe we can use this somehow.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 04:15</strong></p>
<p>I'll be Careful. I've informed my Wife of the Situation. If anything happens to me, she'll make sure to deal with it. They may be powerful beings. But as we like to say here "Hell Hath No Fury Like a Woman Scorned"</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:16</strong></p>
<p>That's good.&nbsp; Make certain those close to you know.</p>
<p>If I set the quills up with culture maybe I can find a lead on Researcher Hyles.&nbsp; It seems relevant given your relationship.&nbsp; If I set up at Admin I might be able to figure out a number of things with Janet.&nbsp; It also concerns me that the Cami-Cat you mentioned came to the discord.&nbsp; If I get in at Necromancy maybe we can gain more intelligence on the investigation for us.&nbsp; Thoughts?</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 04:21</strong></p>
<p>What do you think is best? I have mixed feelings when it comes to Researcher Hyles but gaining intelligence on the investigation doesn't sound like a bad idea</p>
<p>As for Cami, I couldn't begin to guess at her angle</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:23</strong></p>
<p>Mixed feelings how?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 04:23</strong></p>
<p>Chuck has been Contacted. Seems he's under watch since he solved the first Cipher they gave out.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:24</strong></p>
<p>They are contacting a lot of people today it seems…</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 04:24</strong></p>
<p>They seem to be congratulating me but I'll have to be very careful</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:624px;"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/vMUeHnwHLxeS34xVfBa62-b2U41CN0TLhgTlzr36ABLccOUhYDw0JSvFKgA1LxT2EonswRHnICExRanHVe1J4RC84fP82HDxQkCAoRxXwPxe55GUggXiSM77XBZYonyGybsPJYIO"></figure>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:29</strong></p>
<p>I do suggest it.</p>
<p>I'm not the only one investigating here.&nbsp; I welcome the recommendations from you.&nbsp; Necromancy has enhanced security right now, I don't know if we will have a chance in the future with them but they might also cool down later.&nbsp; If we investigate Janet's messages I think we are more likely to get something as she gets many, many correspondences every interval.&nbsp; I don't mean to not prioritize your safety but it might be pragmatic to not look into the situation with Hyles and culture yet with our limited resources.&nbsp; You aren't meeting with Hyles for some time correct?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 04:33</strong></p>
<p>If it happens, it'll be towards the end of the month on the 24th</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 04:34</strong></p>
<p>Oh also Peach I was going to give my tuppence on the matter of where to go first. I think if we go for Admin first then we can get more insight on Janet, who seems to be someone who gets general gossip and more inter-departmental stuff, which in regards to Project Grindstone seems very helpful as we know that it's inter-departmental. Plus you mentioned her hands were stained with orange ink which implies she knows more about the situation with Cami-Cat, which since she has joined the server I'd say can be quite an important topic.</p>
<p>So I think going with Janet will give us more all-around coverage which I think will be best for now, and we can branch out to individual departments when we get accepted and find more suspicious things once we're actually in them. What does everyone else think?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:34</strong></p>
<p>You mean next month?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 04:34</strong></p>
<p>No this month. August 24 in our time.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:35</strong></p>
<p>I suppose your months are different as well...</p>
<p>Not convienent still but that's fine.&nbsp; I'll just need to do more research.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 04:35</strong></p>
<p>We have an odd structure, but we average around 30 days a month, give or take a day.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:37</strong></p>
<p>You make a very good point Chuck.&nbsp; I'd like to hear from the rest.&nbsp; I intend to set up these quills in only a few parts.&nbsp; That is an odd structure.&nbsp; What do you mean average?&nbsp; We get the same 5 weeks each month... Two months in the season.</p>
<p>Nine interval to the week...</p>
<p>And so on.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 04:38</strong></p>
<p>Most months are 30 days, but some are 31, and one month is 28 for some reason. Even we don't get it ourselves. It's just how it is.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 04:38</strong></p>
<p>Yeah our months vary a bit in terms of exactly how many days they are</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 04:39</strong></p>
<p>Even wierder is that every four years, that 28 day month gets an extra day, making it 29 days. Yes, it's as weird as it sounds</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:40</strong></p>
<p>Confusing.&nbsp; I'll try to keep track better.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 04:40</strong></p>
<p>How long is a part for you?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 04:40</strong></p>
<p>Good luck. If not for our technology reminding us what day it is, we'd lilkely not keep track ourselves</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:41</strong></p>
<p>That only leaves 20 intereval before meeting Caleb?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 04:41</strong></p>
<p>Sounds about right</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 04:41</strong></p>
<p>More or less</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 04:41</strong></p>
<p>A day here is 24 hours, which equates to about 1440 of your plane's ticks if I remember correctly</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:41</strong></p>
<p>50 tick</p>
<p>Not quite.&nbsp; A tick if I recall is a little shorter than your minute.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 04:43</strong></p>
<p>Point being we have a while before Shades chats with Caleb if it happens</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:44</strong></p>
<p>So Chuck thinks we should investigate Admin.&nbsp; What say you Shades?&nbsp; Brandon? Snow?&nbsp; Butcher?&nbsp; Gruffles?</p>
<p>I do hope Butcher is okay, I haven't heard from them in awhile.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 04:45</strong></p>
<p>I'm in agreement. BEst to cast a wide net for now</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 04:45</strong></p>
<p>Works for me</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 04:46</strong></p>
<p>Butcher has told us they're sick so they weren't going to be active for a few days, they did talk to us a little bit earlier but hopefully they get better soon</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:46</strong></p>
<p>If no one disagrees in the next few parts then I'll set things up.</p>
<p>I do hope it isn't serious</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:56</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes I surprise myself.&nbsp; I got the new command words programmed.&nbsp; The quills are ready.&nbsp; Just had to duplicate the structure a few times and cut off redundant lines.</p>
<p>I should go install these.&nbsp; Do any of you need anything or have questions before I go?</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 05:00</strong></p>
<p>None from me, just make sure to be safe. It seems like the more we see the more they're looking.</p>
<p><strong>Sir Gruffles — Today at 05:16</strong></p>
<p>Apologies Peach. Duty called for longer than I had anticipated. I'm definitely game to start with Admin before attempting other departments.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 08:43</strong></p>
<p>Now that I'm caught up I agree in researching Admin. I was thinking that if you wanted one of us to infiltrate then Administration was my first thought, but then it was pointed out you need people for the research departments. Also would like to point out, what message did you send to UMAD to get them on high alert Peach? You said you sent them an email?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 15:32</strong></p>
<p>I did not send them an email.&nbsp; I gained access to their email and hid a file away so people like you could find me.</p>
<p>Duty?&nbsp; What is it that you do Gruffles?&nbsp; If you don't mind my asking.&nbsp; I understand if I'm overstepping here.&nbsp; With a name of Sir Gruffles and Duty it elicits an image of noble governance.&nbsp; Are you a vassal of some sort?&nbsp; A Lord or Baron?</p>
<p>I'll be collecting the notes that the quills have made soon by the way.</p>
<p><strong>Sir Gruffles — Today at 15:44</strong></p>
<p>Alas Peach, there is no nobility in my lineage. My duties are at a desk, in the Accounting department of my employer. I have dreams of reaching higher than this desk one day though.</p>

<p>Most of us here have Jobs outside of this. I'm one of the few that, thanks to my work being making videos online, can stay at home all day.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 15:45</strong></p>
<p>Nods I, too, have other obligations. So unfortunately I can’t be here all the time</p>
<p><strong>Sir Gruffles — Today at 15:47</strong></p>
<p>Sir Gruffles is an alias I created to protect my personal information.</p>
<p>Although at this point in time, I'm not worth much more than this name.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 15:48</strong></p>
<p>Don’t underestimate your own value Gruffles</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 16:17</strong></p>
<p>Okay the email is the stego image, got it. Sorry, some of the stuff is lost in translation for me since I joined late and power read through everything so if I mess up on some info I'm sorry and I thank you for correcting me.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 16:44</strong></p>
<p>Accounting is instrumental in operations and decision making in any entity.</p>
<p>There is no need to apologize Snow.</p>
<p>There is a large amount of notes from the quill.&nbsp; I'm looking through everything now.&nbsp; This was only a few part too…</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 16:49</strong></p>
<p>Anything stand out?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 16:49</strong></p>
<p>I'm hoping to find something soon.&nbsp; There is quite a bit.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 16:51</strong></p>
<p>We're standing by if you need us.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 17:50</strong></p>
<p>A few notes here.&nbsp; Some items are very strange though.&nbsp; I might want more time collecting correspondences but it looks like Janet recieves a lot of encypted messages.&nbsp; The first item of note is there is a new Planar department head starting in three intervals.&nbsp; This is never a surprise but they are being given advanced clearance.&nbsp; Level 11 to be specific.&nbsp; Sometimes department heads are designated level 10 with the occasional Planar head only squeezing out a level 9.&nbsp; Level 11 is the highest clearance a department head can be approved.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 17:53</strong></p>
<p>That's interesting. Any idea who the new head is?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 17:54</strong></p>
<p>Next I found not much is mentioned about Project Grindstone but it is mentioned often.&nbsp; I did find that it does directly have something to do with your plane however.&nbsp; The phrase Compulsory Consciousness and Permitted Consciousness are used quite a bit in regards to the project.&nbsp; I'm not sure what is meant by that.</p>
<p>No name was given so far to who the new head will be.</p>
<p>Another strange thing was not every message going to Janet was for Janet.&nbsp; I believe she may be forwarding these messages elsewhere.</p>
<p>What I don't understand is why they would need Janet to forward information.&nbsp; Why not infernal affairs or someone else in administration?</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 17:57</strong></p>
<p>So Janet is acting as an intermediary. Is that unusual?</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 17:58</strong></p>
<p>Could be something confidential... Or maybe some other organization is involved.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 17:58</strong></p>
<p>Compulsory and Permitted. I have a Feeling about what that's about, and it's not a good thing...</p>
<p>I get the sense we're talking Free Will (Permitted) and Obeying a Master (Compulsory)</p>
<p>That's scary</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 17:59</strong></p>
<p>Are you suggesting they're brainwashing people?</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 18:00</strong></p>
<p>That makes sense and would be a reason why so many test subjects are needed</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 18:00</strong></p>
<p>They may be attempting to, or at least indoctrinating them</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 18:00</strong></p>
<p>It would also make sense in regards to how they're reaching out to individual people now - it could be one of the next stages of their plan</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:01</strong></p>
<p>It's not really her job.&nbsp; People often think of her as a secretary which is offensive to her.&nbsp; She however has been seated at a front desk when you enter the tower so...&nbsp; She mostly manages onboarding and employee complaints.&nbsp; Occasionally it's client complaints however.&nbsp; Since she is seated in a convienent place she has started managing schedules, something about it being efficient for resource utilization.&nbsp; She however is not responsible for forwarding messages of this level of security.&nbsp; that could easily be handled by those in correspondence.&nbsp; Furthermore if the message was extra-planar then why not send to the Planar Department?</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 18:02</strong></p>
<p>Unless the Planar Department is out of the loop</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 18:02</strong></p>
<p>Could it be a power grab? Maybe she's consolidating her power for some reason?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:03</strong></p>
<p>I don't think that is the aim but Culture is very good at assisting admin with employee efficiency and compliance.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 18:03</strong></p>
<p>Well it could also have to do with the application process and the applicants since she has a heavy hand in that stuff</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 18:05</strong></p>
<p>It may not be her main goal, but given what we know, Maybe it's a means to an end. My theory is they got spooked about your involvement, and are trying to speed things up to prevent you from figuring it out in time. By making things as efficient as possible, they could certainly do that.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 18:06</strong></p>
<p>Security is double downed so it would make sense.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:07</strong></p>
<p>I also have insight on your next mission.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 18:07</strong></p>
<p>Ooh please indulge</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 18:07</strong></p>
<p>Saw you were asking about me, Peach. Hello, Im back and doing well.</p>
<p>And next mission? Im all ears</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 18:07</strong></p>
<p>Yes, We're Ready. After last night's success, I want to learn more, especially since I'm now a target</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:08</strong></p>
<p>They are organizing a series of tests and getting other researchers involved in the process.&nbsp; The resulting answer to it all will be a single word.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 18:08</strong></p>
<p>Hmm</p>
<p>That's good to know</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:08</strong></p>
<p>One of the research teams involved will be the Planar department.</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 18:09</strong></p>
<p>Well that would make sense if its heavily involved in out plane. Youd want planar studying the foreign plane angle</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 18:10</strong></p>
<p>We haven't even figured out who is in which department though so who knows which researcher is taking the lead</p>
<p>Ral</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 18:10</strong></p>
<p>Wonder if has anything to do with that code Snow Found from Leslie's post? I wouldn't be surprised if that was instead a clue for people to use, but many would have overlooked.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:10</strong></p>
<p>They plan on sending you to an augmented world by means of your technology with visual filters.&nbsp; To you it might appear like a game but there is more there.&nbsp; They will be watching closely for anyone who strays from the test as a potential conspirator.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 18:11</strong></p>
<p>oh boy. We're getting to deep stuff, now</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 18:12</strong></p>
<p>Interesting. So it'll be difficult to dig for more info but there is almost certainly something to going off the 'intended path'</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 18:12</strong></p>
<p>That makes sense to use a AR tool since the next test was supposed to be a field test anyway. If past tests say anything.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:12</strong></p>
<p>Indigo&nbsp; That's an emergency word here.&nbsp; Claiming Indigo without proper clearance can land you into deep trouble.&nbsp; Using Indigo means to operate without approval from accounting and accept expenses later.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 18:13</strong></p>
<p>Oh no should I take down my finding then on the general chat? Or do you think it's too late?</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 18:13</strong></p>
<p>Too late. Undoubtedly the others have seen it already</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:13</strong></p>
<p>Saying Indigo isn't the same as claiming it in operation.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 18:14</strong></p>
<p>Oh man. So why would they code a link to the website with that word. That seems... odd</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:14</strong></p>
<p>While it hasn't been expressed to you, you operate with a Level 2 clearance as an applicant.&nbsp; Clearance level 8 is the minimum requirement to claim Indigo.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 18:15</strong></p>
<p>Okay cool. I mainly did it to try to get on UMAD s good side. Showing I can do something, you know? Maybe it'll help me in the processes.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:15</strong></p>
<p>They might be trying to scare me.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 18:15</strong></p>
<p>Clearly not working</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:16</strong></p>
<p>Getting on their good side would be advantageous for us.&nbsp; I think whatever they want we need you all to perform the best you can.</p>
<p>If I'm ever to be found out it would be helpful for others to be able to work in my leave.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 18:16</strong></p>
<p>Without giving anything away of course lol</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:16</strong></p>
<p>Of Course.&nbsp; I'm sorry if that is demanding of you.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 18:17</strong></p>
<p>Of course not, I'm all for this team! Go PITS!</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 18:17</strong></p>
<p>Hey, We're in this for the long haul. Don't worry about it</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:18</strong></p>
<p>Unfortunately I don't know how much we will learn about Project Grindstone directly this way.&nbsp; It's uncertain what information we could learn, it may or may not be beneficial or quick.&nbsp; Getting a level 10 or 11 clearance would let me access some of the Project documents directly.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 18:19</strong></p>
<p>I will say this, if I go missing, or if I start acting weird, don't hesitate to cut me off. if I'm a target, I dread to think what they'll do to me, or worse... What they'll make me do.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:19</strong></p>
<p>I'm still sorting through everything I took today.&nbsp; We could move to another department or keep things here for now however.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 18:19</strong></p>
<p>Don't worry shades, I'll watch your every move for ya. Out of comradery, not fear</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 18:20</strong></p>
<p>Shades...you'll be fine. Just act casual. Don't give them any reason to suspect you're anything more than a particularly promising candidate. We got your back dude :slight_smile:</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 18:21</strong></p>
<p>At this point, that's no longer my concern. I know I can fake it well enough. But if I'm already a target, all the faking in the world ain't gonna help.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 18:21</strong></p>
<p>If things happen we work it out, we're a team after all.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 18:22</strong></p>
<p>I mean, it could lol. We got this guy's, just make sure not to let anything slip. Hell, even knowing doublelock is a god could land us in trouble</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 18:22</strong></p>
<p>We just need to work efficiently and covertly. Even answering the next mission too quickly can get more eyes on us</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 18:23</strong></p>
<p>With all the materials needed from the last correspondence, one would think we should keep an eye on either alchemy or necromancy right now</p>
<p>What do y'all think? Which department should peach look out for next?</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 18:24</strong></p>
<p>Necromancy is the department you're going into right Snow? Might not be a bad idea to have some inside info</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 18:25</strong></p>
<p>We each have a department we're heading to. Actually, Planar seems a good spot, since a lot of this stuff is in their jurisdicition</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 18:25</strong></p>
<p>Oh yeah, planar would be good to look out for</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 18:26</strong></p>
<p>Planar might be good since it pertains to the next mission, plus if it has a lot of field agents then we can find people to watch out for on our end</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 18:28</strong></p>
<p>If I've learned anything from some of the stuff I've done commentary for, Its to go where the clues lead you. A lot of that info mentions Planar stuff, so the next logical step is to look there.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 18:28</strong></p>
<p>Alright, I vote planar then</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 18:28</strong></p>
<p>Same here</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 18:31</strong></p>
<p>Hey Peach. Does the phrase: "Don't let the limits of indigo color your perspective" mean anything to you?</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 18:32</strong></p>
<p>I also vote planar</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 18:32</strong></p>
<p>And yes, planar sounds like a good choice to me as well</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:33</strong></p>
<p>I'm not familiar with the phrase Brandon.&nbsp; So you want me to move the quill to planar?</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 18:33</strong></p>
<p>Yes please</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:34</strong></p>
<p>It might take longer to generate information there but it may be more practical.&nbsp; I'mnot certain what we will hear for a few intervals however since they lack a department head at the moment.</p>
<p>I think Dowan might be making a pun.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 18:35</strong></p>
<p>Our thoughts as well:sweat_smile:</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 18:36</strong></p>
<p>Yeah even it takes longer it's well worth</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:36</strong></p>
<p>My apologies for taking awhile to get back to you.&nbsp; I'm still sifting through these.</p>
<p>All forwarded messages seem to be to the same individual.&nbsp; I think I can also confirm Researcher March is annapantsu but this isn't really news.</p>
<p>I can also confirm that Janet has recently begun observing the chat herself…</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 18:43</strong></p>
<p>Like as in under UMAD Management or hiding under a username?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:46</strong></p>
<p>I'm not certain.&nbsp; Maybe I can find more soon.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 18:57</strong></p>
<p>Well, we already knew Anna was involved</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 19:14</strong></p>
<p>Since there is a Clearence system, could we know what each levels are? You said applicants are level 2 and department heads range from 9-11 depending.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 19:36</strong></p>
<p>Looking through my noted you said they are looking for a new head of Planar already? What happened to Genevieve Zuchterin? Did she get Planes touched??</p>
<p>Also apparently I was slightly wrong on the decoding and it wasn't 'indigo' but 'indego'. I don't know if that makes a difference or not.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 19:39</strong></p>
<p>The system has levels of 1-15.&nbsp; First level clearance is applicable to those outside the system.&nbsp; Second level is the lowest level of clearance provided to those within UMAD.&nbsp; Employees outside of research have a clearance of three or four.&nbsp; Field researchers start at seven and go up to nine usually.&nbsp; Exceptions can be made.&nbsp; Your performance during your application would assist at higher clearance levels.&nbsp; You will not be informed as to your clearance level until it is either relevant or if you are given a level seven clearance.</p>
<p>Maybe it means nothing?&nbsp; The replaced e might also be to prevent the one reaching out from their operation being mistaken as indigo.&nbsp; Which means they aren't certain enough yet or don't find me as enough of a threat yet...&nbsp; That's good.</p>
<p>Or it's a test?</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 19:45</strong></p>
<p>It was labeled as a random selection test, but I think UMAD took it down after Leslie posted it up on the general chat.</p>
<p>Even TheShades tried almost immediately after it was posted and it was lead to a dead site.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 19:47</strong></p>
<p>The ends always need to be considered when it comes to UMAD.&nbsp; If the information leads to recruitment then they will usually let it slide but if it's an aptitude test and they think the purity of the test is valuable then they will react fast.&nbsp; Ultiamtely it's difficult to know how they will react but it's always a numbers game and according to Accounting how they react.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 19:49</strong></p>
<p>It's always about the numbers :face_exhaling:</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 19:49</strong></p>
<p>We should probably pass that along, covertly, to main chat somehow then. Avoid umad having to many warning bells because we all tend to publicly discuss and share things</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 19:50</strong></p>
<p>Everything said here with Peach needs to be kept confidential in case UMAD gets onto any of us though</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 19:50</strong></p>
<p>This fortunately has been kept under radar but these aptitude tests or surveys could also lead somewhere and if they're axed the second they go live... we'll miss something or bar access somewhere</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 19:51</strong></p>
<p>The test lead to a 404 page though</p>
<p>and it was meant for Leslie unfortunately</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 19:51</strong></p>
<p>I agree for the most part. Thats why i said covertly let people know the umad links probably should be kept to ones self, atleast publicly</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 19:52</strong></p>
<p>Ah yeah that would be smart. Like put it up as a theory type thing?</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 19:52</strong></p>
<p>Right</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 19:53</strong></p>
<p>I agree with that then. Put that out there then, just so you can try to gain brownie points as well. Let UMAD know that you're on the side of secrecy.</p>
<p>What does everyone else think?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 19:55</strong></p>
<p>Just be careful.&nbsp; The delivery could make things either easier or much, much more difficult for us.</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 19:57</strong></p>
<p>I'll work at the wording and submit it here for approval first then</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 19:59</strong></p>
<p>Janet does not seem to directly be forwarding the messages not addressed to her from her desk.&nbsp; She is either taking this information elsewhere or just not forwarding the messages at all.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 20:00</strong></p>
<p>She's withholding information?</p>
<p>Where is this elsewhere? Maybe something like a shredder?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:01</strong></p>
<p>That is a billable offense.&nbsp; I've never known Janet to be anything less than absolutely loyal.&nbsp; She has the opportunity to communicate with the Assistant Headmaster regularly.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 20:01</strong></p>
<p>If you get proof you may be able to report her</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:02</strong></p>
<p>These messages are communicated by transverse wave pattern not by script.&nbsp; This means by speach or air elemental.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 20:04</strong></p>
<p>Oh no. Is there any way for you to record any of the verbal messages? Like stick a recording stone or something to Janet's desk?</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 20:05</strong></p>
<p>If she rarely leaves her desk, that would be difficult to accomplish without being noticed</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 20:05</strong></p>
<p>SHE HAS TO SLEEP</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:06</strong></p>
<p>But she likely locks her office. We'd have to catch a very specific circumstance to pull that off, and odds are not in our favor</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:06</strong></p>
<p>I can't send you visual or audio information...&nbsp; All I can do is inform you on what I find.&nbsp; I can also investigate things from your world by your information and using The Google instrument.&nbsp; With proper direction of course.&nbsp; I have learned a lot from our conversations however.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 20:07</strong></p>
<p>Well even if you can't send it to us you could use it as proof to try to get her out of her seat and hopefully replace her with someone on our side</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:07</strong></p>
<p>The transverse waves by air elemental are provided in a queue at her direction but she has not physical office, just a desk.&nbsp; This means she only listens to her messages when she is not in the presence of others.</p>
<p>That's why I planted the quill.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 20:08</strong></p>
<p>Ah okay</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:08</strong></p>
<p>Seems rather inefficient to me. In our World, most Department Heads would have their own office for this very kind of thing.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:08</strong></p>
<p>All of ours do, except for her.</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 20:09</strong></p>
<p>She has no office, but accesses sensitive information? Seems like a security liability</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:09</strong></p>
<p>I've never been sure as to why...&nbsp; As for sleeping, sometimes I wonder if she does.&nbsp; She seems to always be there and she has no listed schedule.</p>
<p>Yet her record for maintaining sensitive information in impeccable.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:10</strong></p>
<p>I'm beginning to suspect she's not a living being at this point. No living creature could work like she does, that's for sure.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 20:10</strong></p>
<p>Maybe she has some kind of magic or elixir under her belt that makes sleep unneccesary.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 20:11</strong></p>
<p>Or she’s a zombie</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 20:11</strong></p>
<p>Or a construct as well! Expains why she can never be persuaded and such</p>
<p>Lol there IS a necromancy department so maybe??</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:11</strong></p>
<p>That's my thinking, especially with her emphasis on Effeciency, much like a Machine</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 20:12</strong></p>
<p>They do have a necromancy department, and an undead secretary lady who never needs to sleep and could handle sensitive info constantly would be quite useful</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:12</strong></p>
<p>I doubt she is undead.&nbsp; Chill are limited in their capacity here since they are easily manipulated.</p>
<p>Also, I have seen her eat at her desk.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:13</strong></p>
<p>We're just speculating, of course. But based on what you've told us, something doesn't add up. How can ANYTHING be that non-stop and yet still be as effecient as she is. There's something going on with her.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 20:13</strong></p>
<p>Agreed</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 20:14</strong></p>
<p>In our world one has to sleep in order to remain functional and, well, alive. Are there things in your world that can prevent the need for sleep?</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 20:15</strong></p>
<p>Or Snow is correct and she’s some sort of construct. Eating in order to maintain a “normal” appearance isn’t out of the question</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:16</strong></p>
<p>It's possible she utilizes a time dilation.&nbsp; There are risks but if she is familiar with the other plane she can freely travel without concerns of becoming plane touched.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 20:17</strong></p>
<p>:anguished:</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:17</strong></p>
<p>According to my notes she seems to be something of an expert on your plane as well.&nbsp; Although Culture would never claim as such her statements on it seem very well informed and reminiscent of some conversations we have had.</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 20:18</strong></p>
<p>Reminiscent how?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:18</strong></p>
<p>Maybe that's why this experiment is focused here. All the more reason to have someone in the Culture Dept. to look into it</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:23</strong></p>
<p>"Compulsory Consciousness is determined by the Permitted Conscious entities and by will.&nbsp; The will of these entities allow for adoption of the dynamic will of the Compulsory Conscious entities.&nbsp; This will exists as an external motivator for the action of the Compulsory Conscious but also grant stability..."</p>
<p>As you can see it's difficult to unpack this without much reference.</p>
<p>To answer you Butcher, she seems to know about things like the google instrument, reddit, conventions, VR, and a number of other topics.</p>
<p>How your time works…</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 20:25</strong></p>
<p>Those aren’t exactly uncommon knowledge around here. It just means she’s done her research</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:26</strong></p>
<p>I'm merely stating that's why they are familiar.&nbsp; She also has much more information.&nbsp; Technical notes.&nbsp; Answers to strange questions.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:26</strong></p>
<p>But it still goes with my theory, so long as we change a few words: "The Collective is Determined by the Free-Willed Entities and what they will. The WIll of these entities allow for the Adoption of the Changing Will of the Collective Entities. This will exists as an external motivator of the Collecitve, but also grant stability"</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:27</strong></p>
<p>What is Mixcraft?</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 20:27</strong></p>
<p>A recording software?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:28</strong></p>
<p>Like tricky Quill?</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 20:29</strong></p>
<p>A quick search and you’re on to something. It’s a recording program used by musicians apparently</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 20:29</strong></p>
<p>Yeah except it's our version and can edit and delete things from it.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:30</strong></p>
<p>So many things I'm unfamiliar with.&nbsp; I could just post them here and you explain I suppose.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 20:30</strong></p>
<p>And it's video software.</p>
<p>Okay let's see</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:30</strong></p>
<p>"My current setup for recording is an AT2020 microphone that connects via XLR to a Scarlett 2i2 interface. I record via Mixcraft 9 on my laptop in an enclosed space."</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:31</strong></p>
<p>Sounds like one of the Researchers/Singers.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 20:31</strong></p>
<p>That... Sounds like someone's setup from our plane</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:31</strong></p>
<p>Let me break this down to be safe</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:31</strong></p>
<p>That was a response from Janet however.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:32</strong></p>
<p>A Microphone is a tool for Recording Audio. The XLR&nbsp; is a Cable to Connect the Microphone to another Device, in this case the Scarlet 2i2, which allows us to connect it to a Computer.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 20:33</strong></p>
<p>Yeah because that is not my realm of expertise lol Weird, that would mean she has equipment from our plane there. Or like you said, she comes here…</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:33</strong></p>
<p>The Scarlet is a type of an AudioBox, as we call it</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:34</strong></p>
<p>She must have a very technical understanding of your world.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 20:35</strong></p>
<p>Have you ever seen what Cami-cat looks like?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:36</strong></p>
<p>I haven't, only heard about her from you.</p>
<p>You could always send me to an image, video, anything.&nbsp; I'm still not very good at navigating these tools.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:39</strong></p>
<p>Actually, I have just the thing: <a href="https://twitter.com/camicattweets/status/1351387682593767425"><u>https://twitter.com/camicattweets/status/1351387682593767425</u></a></p>
<p>She's the one in the Middle, along with Researcher Hyles on the Right</p>
<p>You might have to open the Link in Google to get the Video to play</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:40</strong></p>
<p>That's... Researcher Hyles definitely.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 20:40</strong></p>
<p>I'm thinking it may be ideal to show you the faces of some of these researchers you've never seen</p>
<p>Well, at least however she's involved</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:40</strong></p>
<p>She looks familiar and her voice seems familiar as well.&nbsp; Any stand alone audio?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:41</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fB479Soa6Q"><u>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fB479Soa6Q</u></a></p>
<p>I've been looking into her already, so I had this ready to go</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:42</strong></p>
<p>No way...&nbsp; I'm sorry I need a moment.&nbsp; I appologize from breaking from professionalism.&nbsp; I just don't understand.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 20:42</strong></p>
<p>It's fine, I figured she'd be important.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:43</strong></p>
<p>Please, give me another video.&nbsp; One not distorted in any way.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 20:43</strong></p>
<p>Will this do? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7OHWb9haMA"><u>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7OHWb9haMA</u></a></p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:43</strong></p>
<p>I need to hear that voice again.</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 20:43</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/vaSxGNq7g5k"><u>https://youtu.be/vaSxGNq7g5k</u></a></p>
<p>Heres one of just her voice. No singing</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:45</strong></p>
<p>I...don't understand.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 20:45</strong></p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:46</strong></p>
<p>I'm gonna take a shot in the dark... That's Janet, isn't it?</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 20:46</strong></p>
<p>What's going on peach</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:47</strong></p>
<p>The voices isn't quite deep enough but she definitely sounds so much like her...&nbsp; We can't let anyone know this yet.&nbsp; We need to hold onto this just in case.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 20:47</strong></p>
<p>Lol oh my</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:47</strong></p>
<p>I KNEW IT! Everything lined up. The big one was when you said she was watching the main chat, not long after Cami-Cat Joined the Server</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 20:48</strong></p>
<p>Janet wouldn't happen to have a twin, would she?</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 20:48</strong></p>
<p>Well well Cami. Perhaps I misjudged you…</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:48</strong></p>
<p>It makes sense, the messages were addressed to Camille.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:49</strong></p>
<p>We'll keep this quiet. Trust us, we don't want this getting out till we make our move. But this is huge.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:50</strong></p>
<p>So Cami is Janet…</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 20:50</strong></p>
<p>So your Janet and our Cami-Cat sound almost identical, and Janet is recieving messages addressed to a 'Camille'. Talk about a deep cover…</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:50</strong></p>
<p>Makes sense why she communicates often to Hyles and March.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:50</strong></p>
<p>And she indeed is from our Plane! A lot of this fits perfectly</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 20:51</strong></p>
<p>She’s friends with Caleb so I’m not surprised. I wonder how long she’s been in on this</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:51</strong></p>
<p>But Janet has worked here for the last eight years…</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:52</strong></p>
<p>Shes's been making videos here for over 10 years, so she was here first. She was recruited, and moved up the ranks</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 20:53</strong></p>
<p>How long has the other researchers like Hyles and March been working for UMAD?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:53</strong></p>
<p>She was recruited directly into her position by the Headmaster himself.&nbsp; Before that we are told she fought in the revolution on the side of Rameus.&nbsp; It was her efforts with the intelligence team organized by Samuel that led to a number of victories for the revolutionaries.</p>
<p>Their names have only shown up recently.</p>
<p>March has been working here for at least a year though.</p>
<p>Maybe longer?</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 20:55</strong></p>
<p>What about Freeman?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:56</strong></p>
<p>About the same time?</p>
<p>It's hard to say without their files.</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 20:57</strong></p>
<p>So Janet is well established in your world, but the others are recent entities with no known history, atleast on records you can access....</p>
<p>How old was umad as an organization again?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:58</strong></p>
<p>Eight years but it took two years to construct our facilities.</p>
<p>This land used to be filled with goblins.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:59</strong></p>
<p>So Janet's been there since the beginning. Yet she was already living a double-life here.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:59</strong></p>
<p>Out of need for work and the promise of education Dial built up around the tower quickly.</p>
<p>It's uncertain.&nbsp; So much isn't clear yet.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 21:01</strong></p>
<p>Wait... I just had a thought. Time works differently between our worlds. Would a Year in your plane be the same length as ours?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 21:01</strong></p>
<p>If we investigate Culture maybe we will get more information on Hyles involvement.&nbsp; Seems more important now that we know about Janet.&nbsp; Unless we are certain we want to investigate Planar.&nbsp; If you find anyone else you want to share with me maybe I can confirm something for you?</p>
<p>I suppose you could do the math on it.&nbsp; From what I've read they seem pretty close.</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 21:02</strong></p>
<p>Culture and planar definitely seem to be the top two deptartments of interest right now. With the newest revelation it may be better to go culture. What do you guys think?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 21:02</strong></p>
<p>I wish I had a higher clearance.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 21:03</strong></p>
<p>Ok, I think we should move to Culture. It might give me some info going into my chat with him later this month</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 21:03</strong></p>
<p>Hey youve already done a lot, peach. We will get there. Itll just take time</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 21:03</strong></p>
<p>I agree, we can continue this train of developments to find more on Hyles and then we can move to Planar to see if there's any more information about the next mission</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 21:04</strong></p>
<p>I agree with Culture, especially since Shades has his interview coming up</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 21:04</strong></p>
<p>Is there any way for us to bypass the Clearance Checks. Hacking, as we call it, to get to that info?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 21:04</strong></p>
<p>I'm going to check the recent scripts and grab the quill.&nbsp; Should only take a few ticks.</p>
<p>Hacking?&nbsp; The bureaucracy of UMAD is a beautiful and terrible thing.&nbsp; It's both a strength and a weakness for them.&nbsp; If I could get clearance documents I could easily just walk through infernal affairs and grab documents.&nbsp; If I have the papers I could even pass myself as the Headmaster.</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 21:06</strong></p>
<p>If they use air elementals to send messages I wonder how possible it would be to intercept and 'hack' one. Or maybe 'program' it to deliver the message to the intended recipient and us/peach as well? Not sure if an elemental can be made a contruct type entity like an undead.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 21:06</strong></p>
<p>Trouble is, they know a fake pretty easily.&nbsp; I'd need the real deal.</p>
<p>We could use the new encryption to make messages for counter intelligence…</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 21:07</strong></p>
<p>You're thinking a Misinformation campaign?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 21:08</strong></p>
<p>Only if necessary.</p>
<p>Just another weapon in our arsenal.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 21:08</strong></p>
<p>Agreed.</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 21:08</strong></p>
<p>Solid option</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 21:08</strong></p>
<p>Anyways, grabbing those docs and the quill.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 21:09</strong></p>
<p>Anything helps</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 21:13</strong></p>
<p>Back</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 21:14</strong></p>
<p>Welcome back</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 21:14</strong></p>
<p>Lot's to sift through</p>
<p>I had a thought, if Cami is Janet then she would be missing from her desk when Cami needs to be visible wouldn't she?</p>
<p>Any way to determine that?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 21:15</strong></p>
<p>Oh My God, you're Right! She does Live Broadcasts from time to time, so we'll look out for that.</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 21:16</strong></p>
<p>Doesn't cami do live streams? We should reach out next time one is on going and see if Janet is still at her desk</p>
<p>Nvm shades beat me to it</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 21:17</strong></p>
<p>Just let me know when she does.&nbsp; If I'm available then I can probably run off to her desk.&nbsp; I live on site afterall.</p>
<p>There is a lot of foxtrot in these scripts.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 21:19</strong></p>
<p>What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 21:21</strong></p>
<p>Foxtrot is yet another encryption.&nbsp; Responses to it are to not be made in foxtrot.&nbsp; All foxtrot messages are receipt only.&nbsp; It's a clearance level 14 encryption.&nbsp; Those who Need to Know the script know it but do not write in it.&nbsp; It was also designed by the Headmaster but during his time as the Headmaster.</p>
<p>Basically only the Headmaster and the Assistant Headmaster use it.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 21:23</strong></p>
<p>Guess we got some work to do. If it's Encrypted, we can try to break it. Hopefully it doesn't require a Keycode</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 21:23</strong></p>
<p>It uses a numeric code with dozens of digits to the character.</p>
<p>Keycode?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 21:23</strong></p>
<p>Nevermind, that won't apply in this case</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 21:24</strong></p>
<p>Some Ciphers need a Keyword to crack</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 21:24</strong></p>
<p>So like the homophonic cipher from earlier but incredibly long?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 21:24</strong></p>
<p>Maybe?&nbsp; It's said he had to create the math for it.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 21:25</strong></p>
<p>I mean, if you could get the equation that might help. If there is one.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 21:26</strong></p>
<p>Foxtrot also has strange pitch.&nbsp; Pitch is something used to mask transverse wave patterns.&nbsp; Pitch isn't utilized often as it requires very advanced aetherial constructs to use and the time it takes to send a message this way is very slow.</p>
<p>Yet Janet has at least four messages in foxtrot just today.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 21:28</strong></p>
<p>Janet should at least in theory have some grasp on how to crack it then, right? She reports to the assistant Headmaster after all</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 21:31</strong></p>
<p>Of course, it wouldn't make sense to send her information in this way otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 21:34</strong></p>
<p>If so then the key to the foxtrot messages might be in Janet's desk, there's no way a single human (as far as we know) could memorise the key to a cipher that involves dozen of digits for a single alphabetical character. She might keep the key close to hand</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 21:34</strong></p>
<p>Oh god. So even more difficult than the one you already sent with custom made math.... im scared guys lol</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 21:35</strong></p>
<p>That makes sense...&nbsp; We just need the key to the Cipher.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 21:36</strong></p>
<p>I'd Say next time she streams, if she indeed isn't at her desk, see if you can find it and make a copy. Stealing it outright would lead to trouble, but a copy of it would be a BIG help</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 21:37</strong></p>
<p>Alternatively we could let it go and focus on listening to the other departments and looking into getting clearance for personelle files and learn about Project Grindstone.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 21:38</strong></p>
<p>Oh we can still do that, but if an opportunity presents itself, we shouldn't pass it up. But we'll hold off for now till that happens</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 21:39</strong></p>
<p>I'm going to set this quill up at Culture before I sift through the rest of these messages.&nbsp; Also... I haven't eaten today.&nbsp; I'll be back later.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 21:40</strong></p>
<p>You go eat and research, we'll do the same. Great job team!</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 21:43</strong></p>
<p>Things just get more and more real</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 23:07</strong></p>
<p>Back</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 23:08</strong></p>
<p>Ok, so what do we got?</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 23:08</strong></p>
<p>Welcome back</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 23:08</strong></p>
<p>Besides indigestion from mess' experiment?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 23:09</strong></p>
<p>Wait what?</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 23:09</strong></p>
<p>Oh no were you working with Pauchik?</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 23:09</strong></p>
<p>I assume he means mess as in mess hall?</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 23:10</strong></p>
<p>Lol</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 23:11</strong></p>
<p>Hyles, March, and Freeman are all planning to start a second round of recruitment shortly after the second mission is released.&nbsp; Admin is trying to finalize a few increased security measures before they release the next mission.&nbsp; It seems I'm the reason why your onboarding was delayed.&nbsp; They do also intend to be more aggressive with the application process to speed things along.&nbsp; I wouldn't be surprised if you finish mission three by end of month.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 23:12</strong></p>
<p>That's promising</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 23:12</strong></p>
<p>UMAD will then close recruitment again and reward participants yet again with one, two, or three invitations.&nbsp; They will then monitor the influx of applicants to gauge potential personnel loyalty.</p>
<p>Three invitations to be provided to those who have succeeded at the previous mission as well as this one.</p>
<p>SC isn't the only party of interest at the Whimsy, so is CO.</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 23:14</strong></p>
<p>Okay so we need to really play in to the 'need to know' theme of secrecy and privacy to get in their good books.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 23:15</strong></p>
<p>Wait, who is CO? That's a new one.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 23:15</strong></p>
<p>They rigged the recruitment so that invitations can extend beyond what they tell you to recruit.&nbsp; If possible I'd invite what you are given, no more and no less.</p>
<p>Not sure.&nbsp; Apparently Marino meets with CO at the Whimsy as well.&nbsp; Seems to know a thing or two about Alchemy.</p>
<p>On my way back here I snagged docs from culture.&nbsp; Haven't looked at them yet.&nbsp; There is only two transcripts though so it's significantly less than Janet's information.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 23:18</strong></p>
<p>Oooh those should help. Hopefully more info on some of the researchers</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 23:18</strong></p>
<p>SC seems to also be somewhere in the discord.</p>
<p>They are organizing a meeting to talk about their continued involvement.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 23:19</strong></p>
<p>None of the names match up, so SC must be thier Real Initials. We'll need more info to ID them.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 23:20</strong></p>
<p>I got more details on technology they use.&nbsp; Not much different from Janet's as far as I can tell but I'm no expert in this.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 23:21</strong></p>
<p>Not surprising, Most Singers and Streamers use similar Tech. I even us an AT2020 Microphone myself.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 23:22</strong></p>
<p>Alright, to the Culture documents...</p>
<p>It looks like Researcher Hyles is a field researcher and is actually part of the Culture Department!</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 23:24</strong></p>
<p>At this rate, I may HAVE to go into Culture, since it's lining up. Hell, they called me a Cultural Expert already</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 23:24</strong></p>
<p>This means he is on an active culture research project.&nbsp; I suspect if I go digging in the active projects he won't be there.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 23:25</strong></p>
<p>Is SC male or female?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 23:25</strong></p>
<p>The pronoun used is he when referring to SC</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 23:25</strong></p>
<p>okay thank you</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 23:26</strong></p>
<p>Anything you can tell us about SC's general background?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 23:26</strong></p>
<p>Not much, just that they seem to know about your recording technology, meet with culture often, and hang around the whimsy a lot.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 23:27</strong></p>
<p>If we sent a picture would you be able to show your operative?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 23:28</strong></p>
<p>If you send a picture I might be able to ID someone.&nbsp; Aside from you all, I'm alone.</p>

<p><strong>Peach — Today at 23:29</strong></p>
<p>Who is this?</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 23:29</strong></p>
<p>Sean Collins, I'm looking through the researcher's Twitter and seeing who they follow and hoepfully finding out who SC is from there.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 23:30</strong></p>
<p>Do you have an older image or one without anything obstructing the face?&nbsp; I'm not a very visual person...nor very good at making out voices.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 23:31</strong></p>
<p>Thing is, he will likely always be wearing that accessory. Those are Glasses, which he uses to help with vision issues.</p>
<p>So any image of him will have that on his face</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 23:32</strong></p>
<p>I understand.&nbsp; I've never seen those, I'm sorry.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 23:32</strong></p>
<p>No need to apologize. If you don't know, you don't know. It's why we're here to fill you in</p>
<p>+</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 23:33</strong></p>
<p>Did you want me to still try this tactic or will it be too much trouble for you?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 23:33</strong></p>
<p>It's no trouble for me.&nbsp; If I recognize someone I'll let you know immediately.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 23:33</strong></p>
<p>Okay cool</p>

<p><strong>Peach — Today at 23:39</strong></p>
<p>I've seen that man at the Whimsy!\</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 23:39</strong></p>
<p>BINGO!</p>
<p>There's your SC</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 23:40</strong></p>
<p>It would be a very good coincidence.&nbsp; The initials match.</p>
<p>I just assumed he was blue banner..&nbsp; He helped set up for one of their performances.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 23:41</strong></p>
<p>But he's not in the Discord. I know his Username: SonicMega, but they're not in here.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 23:42</strong></p>
<p>Hmmm...&nbsp; Maybe they set up another account?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 23:42</strong></p>
<p>Wait... I know what they use for their Twitter Profile Picture, and it's similar to someone in the Server: Volnutt</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 23:43</strong></p>
<p>Yep and Volnutt's profile links to the sonicmega twitch account, so it's pretty safe to say it's Sean Chiplock</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 23:43</strong></p>
<p>And That's the Game!</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 23:44</strong></p>
<p>More and more va's and singers.... all researchers or umad staff. Hmm</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Yesterday at 23:44</strong></p>
<p>Now to continue down this path, we need to ID who CO is. Do we know if they're He or She?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 23:44</strong></p>
<p>It makes sense with culture's involvement.</p>
<p>He and they are apparently also within the chat...</p>
<p>That's it for my notes so far.&nbsp; We can wait on more culture or switch it up.&nbsp; In the meantime I wonder what else I can be doing?</p>
<p>I guess my actual job might be a good start.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Yesterday at 23:48</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, Gotta keep up appearances</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Yesterday at 23:48</strong></p>
<p>Yeah that might be beneficial for appearances lol</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 23:49</strong></p>
<p>I've never been the best at being on time.&nbsp; Maybe NOT doing my job is keeping up with appearances.</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Yesterday at 23:50</strong></p>
<p>Still curious what your job is, exactly.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 23:51</strong></p>
<p>I'm a researcher.&nbsp; The specifics aren't important.&nbsp; Maybe when this is all over we can talk more about it.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Yesterday at 23:57</strong></p>
<p>It would be good to know you a little better, especially with all the info we've been forced to share. But Of course, we know you can't tell us too much, but anything you could revel would help us trust you more.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 23:59</strong></p>
<p>You have to understand, any information I put out there could come back to hurt me.&nbsp; UMAD has lots of resources at their disposal.&nbsp; I trust you now but what happens when they start to offer you opportunity or resources yourself?&nbsp; When does altruism no longer work as a motivator?</p>
