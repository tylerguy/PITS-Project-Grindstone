<p><strong>ChuckMorris — 04:24</strong></p>
<p>Thank you so much!</p>
<p><strong>UMAD-MANAGEMENT — 04:25</strong></p>
<p>Keep up the good work.</p>
<h1><strong><u>14th August 2021</u></strong></h1>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 03:19</strong></p>
<p>Hey I saw in the most recent email that we can ask for help if you deem that people in the discord are worthy. May I ask for help in regards to the second objective?</p>
<p>Myself and the general chat in the server have already figured out that the letters K and F are given in the phone number in an email you sent us and in the source code of the Project Grindstone website respectively. Could I have any clues on where to look next? I did see that more instructions were coming though, sorry if I might be getting a bit impatient haha</p>
<p><strong>UMAD-MANAGEMENT — Today at 03:28</strong></p>
<p>There is nothing wrong with trying to be efficient at your work.&nbsp; Allow me a moment.</p>
<p><strong>UMAD-MANAGEMENT — Today at 04:03</strong></p>
<p>I have spoken to others within our admissions team.&nbsp; We have decided to allow this if you’ll accept supplemental missions to observe your competency.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 04:05</strong></p>
<p>Of course, I'm happy to.</p>
<p><strong>UMAD-MANAGEMENT — Today at 04:08</strong></p>
<p>Assignments provided will also be considered after admissions towards departmental points of commendation.&nbsp; These are something to strive for after admission.&nbsp; These tasks directly benefit our organization as well as help evaluate your strengths.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 04:10</strong></p>
<p>Sounds like this is getting better and better, just let me know what the supplemental missions are.</p>
<p><strong>UMAD-MANAGEMENT — Today at 04:11</strong></p>
<p>Before we proceed, according to our records you were awarded two invitations for success in your last mission.&nbsp; What are the names of your two recruits?</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 04:12</strong></p>
<p>It was ZellaSwiffam and n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕</p>
<p><strong>UMAD-MANAGEMENT — Today at 04:13</strong></p>
<p>You were successful with both applicants?</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 04:13</strong></p>
<p>Yes, they've both joined the discord server</p>
<p><strong>UMAD-MANAGEMENT — Today at 04:15</strong></p>
<p>As you can see, we are looking for more applicants.&nbsp; There has become a recent need for expansion across all research departments.&nbsp; Please note any information provided to you as a reward is Need to Know and you will be designated In Know.&nbsp; For your first assignment recruit as many additional applicants as you can.&nbsp; You have one day from this message.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 04:19</strong></p>
<p>I'll try my best</p>
<p><strong>UMAD-MANAGEMENT — Today at 04:19</strong></p>
<p>Please list future recruits here.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 04:49</strong></p>
<p>Got it. Thanks for the opportunity</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Yesterday at 23:24</strong></p>
<p>I told UnknownEmrys about the project but never directly invited them, I understand that this is a bit of a technicality but I thought you ought to know.</p>
<p>I hope you understand that I do not have much of an online presence, so I attempted to cast the net as wide as possible over discord servers of various fandoms.</p>
<p>Other than that the people who have come onto the discord server likely due to my influence include (and I will continue to update until the deadline arrives, I hope it is to your satisfaction):</p>

<h1><strong><u>15th August 2021</u></strong></h1>
<p><strong>UMAD-MANAGEMENT — Today at 00:03</strong></p>
<p>Understood.</p>
<p><strong>UMAD-MANAGEMENT — Today at 04:17</strong></p>
<p>It is past time</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 04:17</strong></p>
<p>Well it looks like time is up. I can't exactly verify with each name that they all joined exclusively because of my recommendation, but I hope this is adequate</p>
<p><strong>UMAD-MANAGEMENT — Today at 04:18</strong></p>
<p>Provide your final list.&nbsp; We will verify on our own.</p>
<p>You have 6 minutes</p>
<p>We cannot extend your clock.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 04:29</strong></p>
<p>disneyfan0803</p>
<p>marishtar</p>
<p>emerald</p>
<p>Thyme</p>
<p>Xeneroth</p>
<p>The ones omitted from the former list were people who have either left the server or were part of mutual servers in which grindstone was mentioned but I was only tangentially involved in talking about it</p>
<p><strong>UMAD-MANAGEMENT — Today at 04:29</strong></p>
<p>If that is your final list than we will accept it.</p>
<p>Is this your final list?</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 04:30</strong></p>
<p>Yes</p>
<p><strong>UMAD-MANAGEMENT — Today at 04:32</strong></p>
<p>Your performance has been graded as satisfactory and 15 Departmental Points of Commendation will be awarded to you and in the future the department you are assigned to.</p>
<p>Allow me a moment</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 04:34</strong></p>
<p>Thank you very much, no worries</p>
<p><strong>UMAD-MANAGEMENT — Today at 04:39</strong></p>
<p>I’m back.&nbsp; You are permitted a “clue” as authorized by admissions or may ask an approved question about our process, departments, or anything else you may speculate as relevant to your work.&nbsp; Sometimes people cannot know what will be valuable to their work later.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 04:40</strong></p>
<p>May I have a clue?</p>
<p><strong>UMAD-MANAGEMENT — Today at 04:41</strong></p>
<p>Could you ask me more specifically?&nbsp; You would like one clue to what duty or element of what?</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 04:47</strong></p>
<p>What should I be looking for next in regards to the second objective? I know we've been told to wait for more instructions but what kinds of things are going to be coming up?</p>
<p><strong>UMAD-MANAGEMENT — Today at 04:49</strong></p>
<p>There are characters that you will find out of order.&nbsp; One of the final characters might be found from the sky.&nbsp; You’ll need to find it’s coordinates which we are hiding.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 04:51</strong></p>
<p>Ah I see, thanks.</p>
<p>One more thing, if you'll allow me</p>
<p>You mentioned that I can accept supplemental missions for extra information, and I'd very much like to get some more information about what I'm getting into in regards to this academy. If you have any extra missions that I could help out with, could you let me know?</p>
<p><strong>UMAD-MANAGEMENT — Today at 04:53</strong></p>
<p>We have plenty you can do.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 04:55</strong></p>
<p>Good to hear. Anything you'd like done in the immediate future?</p>
<p><strong>UMAD-MANAGEMENT — Today at 04:57</strong></p>
<p>Allow me to speak with admissions.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 04:57</strong></p>
<p>No problem, take your time</p>
<p><strong>UMAD-MANAGEMENT — Today at 05:14</strong></p>
<p>I’ve returned.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 05:16</strong></p>
<p>I saw that there was a small cheese insurgency on the main chat, I can't imagine that was good</p>
<p><strong>UMAD-MANAGEMENT — Today at 05:17</strong></p>
<p>Their Cheese Cult is, as stated, a product of quiet observation and necessary for the admissions process.</p>
<p>While admissions is our primary concern right now there is still a large amount of work to be done.&nbsp; Unfortunately most of this is to be conducted later.&nbsp; Currently we will need assistance with the entrance of these applicants.&nbsp; Our numbers are expected to grow even more in the near future.&nbsp; We will need assistance monitoring and regulating these applicants.&nbsp; We will also assistance locating an undesirable within the ranks of the discord.&nbsp; Lastly we have additional competency evaluations.</p>
<p>What would you like to do?</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 05:30</strong></p>
<p>Oh yeah there was an email mentioning an "undesirable". If I see anything suspicious I'll make sure to mention it. I'm thinking more towards helping out with monitoring and regulating the applicants however, if that's alright.</p>
<p>Also you say the Cheese Cult is a necessary part of the admissions process, out of interest do you get many weird cults in application processes to UMAD?</p>
<p><strong>UMAD-MANAGEMENT — Today at 05:32</strong></p>
<p>These religious institutions aren’t recognized by the Belthean government but are necessary for observation of the development of the observation of the divine by the common crowd.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 05:36</strong></p>
<p>Ah, I see. That sounds like some form of experiment, if you don't mind the comment. I will mention that dairy denominations aren't necessarily how we view whatever divine forces there may be, but it certainly lets you know how the crowd follows each other.</p>
<p>Anyway, how can I help out with the monitoring and regulating?</p>
<p>I stand corrected.</p>
<p><strong>UMAD-MANAGEMENT — Today at 06:06</strong></p>
<p>We are in need of moderators for this discord.&nbsp; If you were to commit to this it would be a temporary position with higher clearance and you would be awarded Departmental Points of Commendation for your activity. &nbsp; You may also be allowed future clues.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 06:12</strong></p>
<p>I can give that a go, it would of course depend on how often I might be needed online but I keep my notifications on so I can respond to complaints and I check the grindstone server fairly frequently, even if I'm not active a lot.</p>
<p><strong>UMAD-MANAGEMENT — Today at 06:16</strong></p>
<p>I will inform infernal affairs.&nbsp; I will provide you information after they get back with me.&nbsp; Should you accept we will prepare your position on the server.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 06:17</strong></p>
<p>Thanks for the consideration.</p>
<h1><strong><u>16th August 2021</u></strong></h1>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 01:41</strong></p>
<p>Sorry if this is pestering but I saw your announcements on the general lounge and I thought I'd ask what additional competency evaluations you had going?</p>
<p><strong>UMAD-MANAGEMENT — Today at 02:10</strong></p>
<p>We do.</p>
<p>You will not be allowed to provide any information on it nor share your work.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 02:11</strong></p>
<p>I understand, my lips are sealed</p>
<p><strong>UMAD-MANAGEMENT — Today at 02:11</strong></p>
<p>Before we begin there is a single question.&nbsp; How did you find this place?</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 02:13</strong></p>
<p>I got it from this tweet by Caleb Hyles. I like his content and was interested, I thought it could be fun <a href="https://twitter.com/CalebHyles/status/1403475360780537857"><u>https://twitter.com/CalebHyles/status/1403475360780537857</u></a></p>
<p>So far it is pretty fun so success there</p>
<p><strong>UMAD-MANAGEMENT — Today at 02:19</strong></p>
<p>Very well.&nbsp; I'll forward this request to Infernal Affairs.&nbsp; Please note that you will be awarded Departmental Points of Commendation after this.&nbsp; Do not share your work.</p>
<p>You will be contacted by myself or someone else soon.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 02:21</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for the opportunity</p>
<p><strong>UMAD-MANAGEMENT — Today at 02:32</strong></p>
<p>Your competency examination will be in three parts.&nbsp; Failure of any of these parts will be noted.&nbsp; Should you run out of time this will also be noted.&nbsp; Should finish early this will also be noted.</p>
<p>In your world you have a false alchemy that can be examined.&nbsp; Never the less it is a good problem solving test.&nbsp; Find the alchemy that came second and create god.&nbsp; Send me the result.&nbsp; We will investigate cheating.</p>
