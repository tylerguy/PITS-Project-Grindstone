<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:29</strong></p>
<p>I'm here</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 00:29</strong></p>
<p>Just in Time, Hyles says he's gonna share something soon. Might be related, but we'll find out soon</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:29</strong></p>
<p>Sudden inspection today of my department</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 00:30</strong></p>
<p>oh damn. Those are never fun.</p>
<p>Probably because of yesterday</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:30</strong></p>
<p>Maybe, I started spying on Researcher discords</p>
<p>Anna just made an announcement</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 00:30</strong></p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:31</strong></p>
<p>Yes</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 00:31</strong></p>
<p>Anything relevant?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:31</strong></p>
<p>Recruitment by the looks of it</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 00:32</strong></p>
<p>So more the same. Guess some Recruited by Twitter, and others by Discord</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:32</strong></p>
<p>Others by something called YT soon</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 00:32</strong></p>
<p>That might be what Hyles is up to</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 00:32</strong></p>
<p>They are really pushing recruitment it seems</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:33</strong></p>
<p>They apparently are using YT for recruitment and future missions.&nbsp; I'm not certain who is using it but UMAD definitely wants to implicate whatever it is.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 00:33</strong></p>
<p>YT = Youtube, the Same place I host my Videos</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:33</strong></p>
<p>Ah, I see.&nbsp; That makes sense.</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 00:33</strong></p>
<p>Might involve another clue for us to find as well</p>
<p>We have 1 minute til he streams</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 00:34</strong></p>
<p>You got a Link, Tyler?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:35</strong></p>
<p>Apparently Logan Laidlaw announced involvement through the stream</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 00:35</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://youtube.com/c/CalebHyles"><u>https://youtube.com/c/CalebHyles</u></a></p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 00:35</strong></p>
<p>Ok, so he doesn't have a Live Page yet</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 00:35</strong></p>
<p>He said to keep an eye on the YouTube</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 00:35</strong></p>
<p>I know that, and I already follow him.</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 00:35</strong></p>
<p>Not sure if he might also be going live on twitch</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 00:36</strong></p>
<p>We were discussing that earlier. He's another Voice Actor, so he might be another Researcher.</p>
<p>He's also BlazingAzureCrow on the main Server</p>
<p>Hyles is Live: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUoXZBa38Dw"><u>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUoXZBa38Dw</u></a></p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 00:40</strong></p>
<p>Live</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 00:40</strong></p>
<p>Its started</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 00:40</strong></p>
<p>The Title mentions a New Cover Album, so making covers of other songs. But we'll keep an eye out for more</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 00:41</strong></p>
<p>Was about to mention that</p>
<p>Does Caleb usually announce streams tho?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 00:42</strong></p>
<p>He does tweet when he goes live, so hard to say if this is any different</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 00:42</strong></p>
<p>watching now</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 00:43</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/CalebHyles/status/1426327928699244547?s=19"><u>https://twitter.com/CalebHyles/status/1426327928699244547?s=19</u></a> might just be a music premier</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 00:43</strong></p>
<p>Still might mention something in passing. Besides, new Music is good enough reason to listen in</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 00:57</strong></p>
<p>Looks like Janet (Cami) is in the Chat as well.</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 00:58</strong></p>
<p>:eyes:</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:58</strong></p>
<p>Looks like the Anna Discord is exploding.&nbsp; This is a big victory for UMAD.</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 00:59</strong></p>
<p>What's happening in Anna's discord exactly?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:00</strong></p>
<p>She seems to have invited them to the project</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 01:00</strong></p>
<p>So her whole discord now has access to the project…</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 01:00</strong></p>
<p>Let me check. Her discord is open for all</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:00</strong></p>
<p>They linked The Shade's report on reddit</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 01:01</strong></p>
<p>What?</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 01:01</strong></p>
<p>They're using shades post to bring people in?</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 01:01</strong></p>
<p>but why?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:01</strong></p>
<p>UMAD just requested a general staffing call to action.&nbsp; Something is happening here.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 01:01</strong></p>
<p>Wow! Now I have my In</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 01:02</strong></p>
<p>somethings up?</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 01:02</strong></p>
<p>Something is definitely happening here</p>
<p>Shades seems to be in the middle of it</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 01:02</strong></p>
<p>i got a bad felling about this</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 01:03</strong></p>
<p>Well let's see where this leads. Best I keep an eye out for now</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 01:03</strong></p>
<p>Agreed</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:05</strong></p>
<p>I thought I might be safe for awhile here since there are so many people but eventually I will need to leave.</p>
<p>by here I mean her discord</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 01:05</strong></p>
<p>then go</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 01:06</strong></p>
<p>Its probably best for you not to be seen anywhere, especially since your department was under investigation</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:15</strong></p>
<p>Checked engineering messages</p>
<p>A lot to go through but right now know that they are planning an email tonight</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 01:15</strong></p>
<p>Yes, please indulge</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:15</strong></p>
<p>They are opening the flood gates soon to the discord</p>
<p>They also plan to do this more than once.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 01:16</strong></p>
<p>CRAP! I'm gonna be busy tonight! Why does keep happening; every time I'm busy, that's when things happen</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:16</strong></p>
<p>probably coincidence...&nbsp; maybe on purpose?</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 01:17</strong></p>
<p>UMAD can now mind read</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 01:17</strong></p>
<p>How would they know my Schedule? Are the Stalking me or something</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 01:18</strong></p>
<p>Wouldn't surprise me</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 01:19</strong></p>
<p>Seems Anna's Discord is struggling with the first Mission, lol</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:20</strong></p>
<p>I'd let it go</p>
<p>Too many successes and you'll be looking at competition for their good graces later</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 01:20</strong></p>
<p>Any lead we can get on the rest is probably a good thing</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:21</strong></p>
<p>I'm sorting through these messages as fast as possible.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 01:21</strong></p>
<p>They're gonna keep trying to recruit regardless, so they may help their own to get there. Not really gonna make a difference. our crew can solve much faster than these guys. Plus, me taking initiative might help keep me in said good graces as well</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:23</strong></p>
<p>good point</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 01:23</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/annapantsu/status/1426332481712754689?s=19"><u>https://twitter.com/annapantsu/status/1426332481712754689?s=19</u></a> Anna tweeted about it</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 01:23</strong></p>
<p>Now the rest of us needs to look good lol</p>
<p>Besides Chuck and Tyler. The processing speed on those two</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 01:26</strong></p>
<p>They seem to be at the Polybius square stage now</p>
<p>Don't think it'll be long before they figure it out</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 01:28</strong></p>
<p>Not so sure. They can't even get past the Polybius Cipher, and they still need to find it's a Viginere Cipher afterwards</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:29</strong></p>
<p>With as many people as there is it'll only be a matter of time</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 01:30</strong></p>
<p>But it does mean we still have the edge. With some of the people we have here, we'll have it figured out long before they do. I'm not worried.</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 01:30</strong></p>
<p>Everyone still has Access to the second objective, even if they haven't solved the first</p>
<p>But we still have the edge of knowing what to look for</p>
<p>And the 2 letters we've already found</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:31</strong></p>
<p>Engineering and aetherial studies worked to create the current instruments UMAD is using to look into your world.&nbsp; They have been in contact with a number of people for well over a year now while others for a much shorter time.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 01:32</strong></p>
<p>Makes Sense. They would need time to set all this up and to get people to help on this end</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 01:33</strong></p>
<p>Ok, so they don't yet know what the 3rd stage is</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 01:33</strong></p>
<p>They're getting close, though</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 01:34</strong></p>
<p>There's some smart people in this discord</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 01:38</strong></p>
<p>i'm going to be up till 7 in the morning so i'm good</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 01:38</strong></p>
<p>Bowser and Ghostconsultant are two to watch, I'd say</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 01:38</strong></p>
<p>Yeah</p>
<p>Is ghost trying to bruteforce it?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 01:41</strong></p>
<p>YEah, but Bowser got it</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 01:43</strong></p>
<p>Bowser is definitely one to watch</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 01:44</strong></p>
<p>Indeed</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 01:46</strong></p>
<p>Mail</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 01:46</strong></p>
<p>Bowser is now in the main discord</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 01:46</strong></p>
<p>E-mail</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 01:46</strong></p>
<p>Looks like it just welcoming the new guys</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 01:46</strong></p>
<p>K</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 01:53</strong></p>
<p>Was there anything else from the engineering reports?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:03</strong></p>
<p>Oh lord. Anna's discord is flooding the main Server. She has over 1100 People in her's, so that main server is gonna be a mess from here on out. We might just have the edge here.</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 02:04</strong></p>
<p>Indeed</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:07</strong></p>
<p>Sorry, back</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 02:07</strong></p>
<p>welcome back</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 02:07</strong></p>
<p>Hope everything's fine</p>
<p>How was the general staff meeting?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:09</strong></p>
<p>They are discussing possibly repeating this recruitment technique with Caleb in the future but there is no confirmation.&nbsp; I've also confirmed through both Alchemy and Engineering that Hanford has a different alias in your world.&nbsp; There is also no intention to replace the head of engineering.&nbsp; The position is open and there have been several applications but the Assistant Headmaster has not decided on anyone at this time.</p>
<p>I didn't go to the general staffing meeting or at least all of it.&nbsp; Anyone who is within the research teams only has to voluntarily.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:11</strong></p>
<p>Ok, so we need to figure out Hanford's Alias. If only we had any clues where to look.</p>
<p>Like what they might be known for here. That might point me in the right direction</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:17</strong></p>
<p>All I know is they are also in the discord at this time.</p>
<p><strong>ZellaSwiffham — Today at 02:18</strong></p>
<p>im up, so whats this new email about</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:18</strong></p>
<p>With how many people just joined, that's gonna be tricky.</p>
<p>I wonder if that Logan Laidlaw fellow is him?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:19</strong></p>
<p>A Boatload of new people just showed up, so the e-mail was just welcoming them. Nothing new for us.</p>
<p><strong>ZellaSwiffham — Today at 02:19</strong></p>
<p>ahhhh okay i thought there wasnt much in it, thx</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:58</strong></p>
<p>UMAD just spoke in the main chat:</p>
<p><i>UMAD-MANAGEMENT — Today at 9:57 PM</i></p>
<p><i>All dimensions beyond fifth are illusions based on artifact data and ought not be observed.</i></p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 02:59</strong></p>
<p>saw that</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 03:00</strong></p>
<p>UMAD messaged me back</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 03:00</strong></p>
<p>what?</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 03:00</strong></p>
<p>I asked the in a DM if I could as k questions and they said yes but it could be need to know or limited.</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 03:01</strong></p>
<p>K</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 03:01</strong></p>
<p>I started with asking what doublelock was.</p>
<p>I need to keep some kind of front and ask things that the general chat would know. Is there any questions anyone can think of?</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 03:03</strong></p>
<p>What is Project Grindstone?</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 03:04</strong></p>
<p>I'll ask that next. I'm doing this one at a time</p>
<p>Need to know is what they said about project grindstone</p>
<p>They said the same about doublelock that Peach said</p>
<p>I asked about the different departments since I don't 'technically' know</p>
<p>Not within my clearence to know the departments they said. I asked what was within my clearence.</p>
<p>They said need to know. I asked if I could know anything about Janet, Bruce, or Pauchik. Surface data, you know?</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 03:16</strong></p>
<p>Uh the mysterious SC just said "A". Idk if that could be part of the solution to the second objective</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 03:23</strong></p>
<p>I don't know what else to ask without looking sus.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 03:23</strong></p>
<p>I'm asking for clues about the second objective</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 03:32</strong></p>

<p><i>The applicant scorecard is private to admissions and will be released at the end of your application process.&nbsp; The score is an integer at minimum value 1 and maximum value 100.</i></p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 03:34</strong></p>
<p>Yeah...&nbsp; I scored an 88</p>
<p>your score used to be public but that's no longer the case.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 03:35</strong></p>
<p>I asked what was passing and they said need to know. What is passing and what do they grade on?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 03:35</strong></p>
<p>I think it was Culture's idea to breed competition at first.</p>
<p>No idea, I knew someone who had a 70 one year and got in.&nbsp; Another friend of mine was given employee status but couldn't make researcher track at 86 another year.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 03:36</strong></p>
<p>That's weird</p>
<p>Different scores but the higher score got lower clearence</p>
<p>So the number doesn't matter but the person?</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 03:37</strong></p>
<p>maybe it's not just the number they are testing us on</p>
<p>maybe there's other factors in play</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 03:38</strong></p>
<p>I could believe that.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 03:38</strong></p>
<p>Is there anything anyone can think of to ask them?</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 03:39</strong></p>
<p>maybe you ask whether it's just the score they're taking into account</p>
<p>maybe it might be a good idea to move the quill into culture, given all the stuff we've learnt today</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 03:43</strong></p>
<p>Do you think we should recruit more people or is 12 ample?&nbsp; I don't know how many of these people are actual applicants but there is so much going on in the annapantsu discord…</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 03:44</strong></p>
<p>we've got our eyes on some people, might be worth recruiting them before they become more of a competitor</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 03:46</strong></p>

<p><i>I see a lot of different pictures like a manor and mines and such and wanted to know if all the locations were based in Obelus City. That's the only full city map and the floating landmass(?) in it is used as the Project Grindstone icon on web tabs.</i></p>

<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 03:55</strong></p>
<p>Interesting</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 03:55</strong></p>
<p>Ah fun.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 03:57</strong></p>
<p>The discord will be reorganized soon to prepare for new applicants.&nbsp; They are also preparing for future missions.&nbsp; It seems that Engineering has submitted lesson plans to Janet to help facilitate the construction of your final application mission.</p>
<p>March, Hyles, Janet, Laidlaw, and Hanford have confirmed their participation in mission three.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 03:58</strong></p>
<p>Hanford is the only one we haven't identified.</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 03:58</strong></p>
<p>We'd better get on that</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 03:58</strong></p>
<p>So far we knows she's female</p>
<p>And that Hanford is an alias</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:05</strong></p>
<p>all I could confirm is they were wished success on "A Dream" today.</p>

<p>Hi Peach, whenever youre free could you elaborate on what UMAD have said about the Belthidian law and the Toristic processes of observation?</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Yesterday at 22:33</strong></p>
<p>peach is not in the main server</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Yesterday at 22:40</strong></p>
<p>they didnt elaborate anything in the main server but did repeately mention those two things, but we dont currently know what those things are</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 23:05</strong></p>
<p>There are so many messages.</p>
