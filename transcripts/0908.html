<p><strong>Snow_Woman â€” 17:50</strong></p>
<p>Hey Peach, do you have access to the Project Grindstone website where we're pulling everything from? I know it's limited in what you can see, but I wanted to know if you've seen the letter sent by Michael Hope in the Terms and Condition tab and wondered if you had an inkling of what town it went to.</p>
<p>It was sent to a mayor Augustine</p>
