<p><strong>SBButcher — Yesterday at 7:08 PM</strong></p>
<p>Hello</p>
<p><mark class="pen-red"><strong>[Peach’s messages appear in reverse hexadecimal]</strong></mark></p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 7:11 PM</strong></p>
<p>Excellent, glad you're here!&nbsp; I won't be online all the time but any questions you may have I'll do my best to answer them.&nbsp; Before we jump into things I'm sure you have many questions.</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Yesterday at 7:13 PM</strong></p>
<p>So many. First, should I be responding like you do?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 7:17 PM</strong></p>
<p>I'm not certain what you are asking but I'm assuming what I send you comes out a little strange.&nbsp; This is to be expected through unconventional divination.&nbsp; I don't exactly have all the resources that UMAD does to do what I'm doing now.</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Yesterday at 7:22 PM</strong></p>
<p>[Done in reversed hexadecimal] I'm asking if I should respond like this. I assumed it was to hide from UMAD, but now you seem surprised that your message was less than clear.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 7:24 PM</strong></p>
<p>That seems to come through more clearly on my end but it's not necessary.&nbsp; I can adjust for convenience.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Yesterday at 7:29 PM</strong></p>
<p>God this is cool, ok. I'll be in touch.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 7:32 PM</strong></p>
<p>May your walls be salted.&nbsp; We will talk later.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Yesterday at 11:26 PM</strong></p>
<p>So I guess while I wait for anyone else to join us (You noted that you were talking with several others), I notice two of the Server Admins are in here as well. I have to ask what their involvement in this is?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 11:30 PM</strong></p>
<p>The server admins are just artifacts for necessary communication through these unconventional means of divination.&nbsp; Wallflowers, accessories if you will.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Yesterday at 11:34 PM</strong></p>
<p>Ive noticed the admins have never spoken in server, atleast not that Ive seen.</p>
<p>Probably a 'they own the server' thing?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 11:37 PM</strong></p>
<p>Artifacts in aetherial spellcraft happens often.&nbsp; I will need to attend to some things but please ask any questions and as many questions as you want.&nbsp; I'll answer when I come back tomorrow.</p>

<p>Heya</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 11:38 PM</strong></p>
<p>I'll be taking my leave now.</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Yesterday at 11:38 PM</strong></p>
<p>Okay Peach so when you say umad isnt who they say they are, what does that mean?</p>
<p>So wait he leaves just when new people arrive? Uggh cliff hangers...</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Yesterday at 11:40 PM</strong></p>
<p>Lol, just bad timing. Still, we're onto something here, so let's see what they have to tell us</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Yesterday at 11:41 PM</strong></p>
<p>For sure.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Yesterday at 11:41 PM</strong></p>
<p>I suppose that gives us a bit of time to acclimatise to this</p>
<p>Maybe they're talking to someone new, we don't know how many people could've figured out the steganography</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Yesterday at 11:42 PM</strong></p>
<p>Or hell even what timezone theyre in. Doesnt seem to be a bot so, who knows where theyre at in their day</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Yesterday at 11:43 PM</strong></p>
<p>Very true</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Yesterday at 11:46 PM</strong></p>
<p>Also not sure how much to 'think out loud' here either</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Yesterday at 11:47 PM</strong></p>
<p>Yeah true</p>
