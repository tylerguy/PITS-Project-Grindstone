<p>Fair enough. Can't be too careful. Maybe as time goes on, it might become neccesary, but we'll bench that for now</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:02</strong></p>
<p>I appreciate that...&nbsp; I'll tell you what though, if I find a way to make this beneficial for you maybe I will have that security.&nbsp; It's just a thought.</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 00:05</strong></p>
<p>Fair enough. I look forward to the day we can know more about you, and not just your world</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 00:06</strong></p>
<p>I know this is a stupid longshot but every CO I find in the researcher's following I'm posting so here's Conan O'Brien</p>

<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:07</strong></p>
<p>Shades, you said you interview people?&nbsp; You have a connection with Researcher Hyles who is an entertainer in your world?</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 00:08</strong></p>
<p>….</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 00:08</strong></p>
<p>Not Directly. I've recorded a few of his Concerts and done streams of them with him, but not much beyond that.</p>
<p>Same goes with many of those I've interviewed.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:08</strong></p>
<p>I've read the name but likely only a coincidence.&nbsp; I've never seen this man and I have never heard of a researcher by that name.</p>
<p>Something wrong Brandon?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 00:09</strong></p>
<p>We kind of figured, but had to check</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 00:09</strong></p>
<p>Just processing all of this</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:10</strong></p>
<p>Why do you interview them?&nbsp; Why do you record them?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 00:11</strong></p>
<p>It's all for Entertainment. The People I interview are entertainers, and we like to get to know them better. Same with the Concerts. We want to share their musical performances with others, cause they do some amazing work.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:12</strong></p>
<p>We?</p>
<p>You do this to entertain yourself?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 00:12</strong></p>
<p>Myself, and anyone who watches my Content. I have Fans, people who enjoy my work, as well as fans of the Entertainer, so they can enjoy it as well</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:13</strong></p>
<p>You make these visual transmissions like what you send me with Cami-Cat?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 00:15</strong></p>
<p>Yep! I normally Review Anime, a type of Animation made in the Country of Japan. Those are usually the kind of entertainers I interview; those who voice characters in that kind of media. many of the Researches make covers, or Recreations of Music from these Anime.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:15</strong></p>
<p>You also interviewed this Matpat?&nbsp; Is Matpat part of anime?</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 00:16</strong></p>
<p>Matpat is a giant name in the internet world</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 00:16</strong></p>
<p>He covers Video Games, another type of entertainment. He and I did used to work together many years ago, but I haven't talked with him for a long time now.</p>
<p>He's a bit of a researcher in his own right, as he looks at the story and science of different games, and tries to fill in the gaps with his own theories. His channel is actually called "The Game Theorists"</p>
<p>btw, here's a sample of my work. So you can see what I do: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZCgpDOUOZg"><u>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZCgpDOUOZg</u></a></p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 00:24</strong></p>
<p>Oh lord Madoka Magica:fearful:</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 00:34</strong></p>
<p>Also, We might have identified another person. The user Daxel is almost certainly the brother of Researcher Hyles.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 00:34</strong></p>
<p>....</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:35</strong></p>
<p>This is what you do theshades?&nbsp; I wasn't aware Researcher Hyles had a brother.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 00:36</strong></p>
<p>...Yes. Caleb has an older brother</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 00:36</strong></p>
<p>He does, and he has a wife, who's in the server as well, under Pumpkin_Ice</p>
<p>And yes, those kind of videos are the main thing I do.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:38</strong></p>
<p>I suppose I know little about the researcher's personal lives...&nbsp; I spend so much time at work and doing this I guess I don't socialize too much.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 00:38</strong></p>
<p>Fair enough</p>
<p>I'm not even sure Daxel is involved to be honest. He could be just be here to support his brother. Though I have no idea. Anything is possible</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 00:41</strong></p>
<p>Most likely both of them are. But we should still make note, so we can be careful around them</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 00:42</strong></p>
<p>They don't interact a whole lot on discord so I doubt you have much to worry about</p>

<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 00:47</strong></p>
<p>Who's that?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:48</strong></p>
<p>I'm not familiar with this person either</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 00:48</strong></p>
<p>I'm looking for CO male names, I'm looking through March's twitter for who she follows right now</p>
<p>I'm looking through all of them</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 01:01</strong></p>
<p>Ok, I think we need more info to figure out CO. I've check every person in this server, and none of them have anything that could help us Identify them, We've even checked the other Researchers' Twitter Friends, and found nothing that fits. We're gonna need more before we can ID him</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 01:01</strong></p>
<p>I suppose he prefers anonymity</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:05</strong></p>
<p>I could always explore the whimsy sometime.&nbsp; It's very difficult to get food but drinks are decently priced there.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 01:05</strong></p>
<p>Oooh do they have coffee?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:07</strong></p>
<p>Orzzo.&nbsp; It's a little difficult to get coffee this far North.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 01:07</strong></p>
<p>Orzzo?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:08</strong></p>
<p>Plus now that the boarder radicals have been more active the cost in a nightmare.&nbsp; Most of it supplied by boat.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 01:08</strong></p>
<p>Must not be as easy to produce as it is here. We have Coffee all over the place here.</p>
<p>ahhh... That explains it</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:09</strong></p>
<p>Sounds nice.&nbsp; Back in the days of Othello I had the fortune of living near a lord down near Paint.&nbsp; I used to be able to smell it during noon.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 01:09</strong></p>
<p>That sounds pleasant</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 01:10</strong></p>
<p>Maybe if you ever came to our plane, you could try some of the Interesting ways we serve coffee. It's not just straight Black here.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:10</strong></p>
<p>Orzzo isn't so bad though.&nbsp; Not to mention most people are suspicious of coffee.</p>
<p>&nbsp;don't think I understand what you mean by different ways to serve it?</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 01:11</strong></p>
<p>I prefer a chilled flavored variant of coffee myself</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:11</strong></p>
<p>Orzzo is a drink maid from Barley</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 01:11</strong></p>
<p>Let's just say we've found many ways to drink coffee. I'd be here all day if I tried to explain them</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:11</strong></p>
<p>According to the google tool your people have it as well.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 01:11</strong></p>
<p>I presume we call it beer here</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:12</strong></p>
<p>Chilled?&nbsp; I think something is lost in communication.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 01:12</strong></p>
<p>What is Coffee to you guys</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:12</strong></p>
<p>We have beer too.&nbsp; This is very different.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 01:12</strong></p>
<p>That means I like my coffee cold</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 01:12</strong></p>
<p>Ah I see</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 01:12</strong></p>
<p>Instead of hot like is traditional</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:12</strong></p>
<p>Use the google.&nbsp; You'll see</p>
<p>You let the coffee go stale?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 01:13</strong></p>
<p>No, we put ice and stuff. We even found a way to brew it cold.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 01:13</strong></p>
<p>Well there are malt drinks, and whiskey</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:13</strong></p>
<p>My preferred beverage is a good milk stout.&nbsp; It keeps you healthy.</p>
<p>You can afford an elemental?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 01:14</strong></p>
<p>We have Machines that can do it. I told you before, we don't have magic here</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:14</strong></p>
<p>Elementals aren't aetherial.</p>
<p>You say you don't have magic then mention a construct with thermokentic spellcraft in programming...</p>
<p>Thermokinetic</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 01:16</strong></p>
<p>We have Science. It can seem like Magic, but it's all Physical reactions and things like that.</p>
<p>Peach — Today at 01:16</p>
<p>Unless it's alchemical?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 01:16</strong></p>
<p>It's silmilar to Alchemy, just not as mystical</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:16</strong></p>
<p>That's very familiar to me.&nbsp; Belthidian law.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 01:16</strong></p>
<p>Belthidian?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:17</strong></p>
<p>All phenomena are mystical.&nbsp; Why else would we do toristic experimentation to find answers?</p>
<p>Yes...not to be confused with Belthean…</p>
<p>In hindsight not a very good name for a country if you ask me.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 01:17</strong></p>
<p>I see. For us, the opposite is true: All phenomenon can be explained, so nothing is mystical here.</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 01:18</strong></p>
<p>Belthidian law is akin to our laws of physics if im remembering a prior convo correctly</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 01:18</strong></p>
<p>We can break down to the smallest particles how something works</p>
<p>.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:18</strong></p>
<p>All phenomena?&nbsp; And&nbsp; you have such explanations?&nbsp; We believe that anything can be explained but this requires dedicated research and toristic practices.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 01:19</strong></p>
<p>And we have people whose whole career is that kind of dedicated research. We call them Scientists</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:20</strong></p>
<p>I've used the google tool to look at science.&nbsp; Give me a moment.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 01:20</strong></p>
<p>...This could take a while</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 01:21</strong></p>
<p>Lol</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 01:21</strong></p>
<p>I wonder if toristic practice is similar in thought&nbsp; to the aristolian method? Like maybe Tor was the name of some big scholar there or something?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:21</strong></p>
<p>The scientific method looks like Torism to me</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 01:22</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, that's all we have. We don't have any kind of mysticism, though there are some who claim they do, but nothing believable. Pretty much scams and parlor tricks.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:23</strong></p>
<p>Tor is in fact a a brilliant scholar</p>
<p>I don't think our practices are all too different</p>
<p>Here at UMAD we have a wealth of resources to practice the toristic approach to study which is founded in logic.&nbsp; This seems to be nearly identical to your scientific method.</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 01:24</strong></p>
<p>It sounds like the 'practice' of research follows similar methods in both planes but where they have elementals and aetherial components we have.... well everything in our natural world</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:25</strong></p>
<p>I've always personally hated the world natural.&nbsp; If all things can be explained the connotation concerns me as to an unnatural.&nbsp; Afterall everything was created by Belthid according to their laws.</p>
<p>Although I've always find it strange we credit that to Belthid if there are so many gods presiding over all domains and a few just as old as Belthid.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 01:27</strong></p>
<p>Sounds more like Religious Preaching than anything. We have Religions that preach similar things, how our World was created by a Single God.</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 01:27</strong></p>
<p>Or several depending on which faith one follows, if they follow one at all</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:28</strong></p>
<p>There are those who don't find gods enigmatic but actually just the most simple of systems.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 01:28</strong></p>
<p>I've only started reacquinting myself with faith recently</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 01:28</strong></p>
<p>And many of them tell you that if something cannot be explained, you should "Just Believe". It'd be silly, if it didn't lead to some dangerous results</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:29</strong></p>
<p>It sounds like your faiths are very Hellshian in nature.&nbsp; I for one disagree with this and prefer the temples that encourage you to become more familiar with your god through questioning.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 01:29</strong></p>
<p>In our world Peach, we would refer to such individuals as "Atheists"</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 01:29</strong></p>
<p>I wish we had more like this in our world. Might make our world a better place.</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 01:29</strong></p>
<p>Your world seems to have a unified stance on what deities exist(in so much as youve described them), even if practices and sects differ. Ours is more faith based. Our science has yet to show evidence of any sort of deity. And if one exists they haven't exactly announced themselves clearly.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 01:29</strong></p>
<p>Intriguing. Though I have found that the particular approach depends on the individual</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:29</strong></p>
<p>I'm familiar with atheism.</p>
<p>Maybe our concept of god differs greatly too and that is an unknown miscommunication</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 01:31</strong></p>
<p>Perhaps. Theres much we dont understand of each others worlds yet</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 01:32</strong></p>
<p>Connor Colquhoun. Not CO initials, but he's someone that's showed up multiple times and has it in both names</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:211px;"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/XAEz3aqNmXRp2-hc3UdzPzW599f3dZ4z-2k6wI6qtKCI2SyWu9kNAz42U8m_-g1w2mAlDTShvJowOSkdhsgNu_5AUrKCs3HZLrU5x-71qegbPpskefOl1BvymCz2z0yWX1B-FtjY"></figure>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 01:33</strong></p>
<p>I think that's stretching it a bit:sweat_smile:</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:33</strong></p>
<p>I appreciate your dedication but still not someone I recognize.</p>
<p>I think it's about time to grab some more of the documents.</p>
<p>Off to Culture I go.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 01:34</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, I'm blind diving here lol</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:54</strong></p>
<p>Back</p>
<p>A few more pages</p>
<p>It seems they get roughly a tenth of the messages Janet does</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 01:55</strong></p>
<p>Oof She's been withholding a lot</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 01:55</strong></p>
<p>Still, hopefully we got something good here</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:59</strong></p>
<p>Looking through it all now.</p>
<p>"Baiting was successful.&nbsp; Our current research on social media suggest not only levels of efficiency in reach of prospective candidates but several recent information leaks as well as free public information on the most intimate aspects of the extra-planar lives.&nbsp; I suggest beginning a threat level assessment.&nbsp; We will start at a level of individual candidates to be determined by Meer Soot's method of random selection.&nbsp; Following this a planar level assessment. We will need an increase of candidates and so I suggest utilization of current applicants and campaigning for recruitment with current staff.&nbsp; Failing this more forceful techniques may need be implicated.&nbsp; Given current readiness, candidate status, and the need for more engagement and applicants I suggest initiating the next stage of the application within an interval's time.&nbsp; Will stand by to confirm this timeline."</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 02:06</strong></p>
<p>Interesting</p>
<p>This would seem to confirm that they intend to start recruiting again</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:08</strong></p>
<p>So that's their outer plan. They tested to see if Social Media would help with recruitment, so now they plan to double their efforts with us involved, picking a few random candidates to help out. If that doesn't work, they have other methods that we won't like. But this means they're making their move now.</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 02:13</strong></p>
<p>I see the mad genius was involved too. Even more reason to go engineering</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:14</strong></p>
<p>They mention a Researcher Hanford in these documents.&nbsp; They work for Alchemy it seems and are one of your people.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:16</strong></p>
<p>Hanford. Does this guy look like him:</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:229px;"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/WEFHq21lEay2jW2Iaq03UypnA_gLAPwLNqeyzcgXtgWygubAG77ocJ0Px5TYO1wD09UhWoD9q3yOb4GAF88U6EGOcg_zAuIJn3Hvzjz7imrnqgS9fDuZXD5cM1U1CVReJXxelvQq"></figure>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:16</strong></p>
<p>Hanford seems to have the pronoun she</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:16</strong></p>
<p>Well, Damn</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:17</strong></p>
<p>There is also a Mann and Khan mentioned but they don't seem to be researchers.&nbsp; It seems they are your kind assisting as consultants.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 02:18</strong></p>
<p>Hmm I haven't a clue who these could be</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:19</strong></p>
<p>Same. There's quite a few people with that name, so this will take some digging.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:19</strong></p>
<p>I don't think this the surface we are scratching but by no means everything.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 02:19</strong></p>
<p>And how do we know these names aren't codenames or nicknames?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:20</strong></p>
<p>We don't</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:20</strong></p>
<p>To be honest, though, the fact all the others we've learned have been their real names, so I'd stick to that line of thinking for now</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:21</strong></p>
<p>That's why I don't think we are hardly close to the larger secrets of this project</p>
<p>They bothered with some security but didn't even really try at hiding names.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 02:22</strong></p>
<p>Not all Shades. Cami wasn't operating under her real name remember?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:23</strong></p>
<p>That's an Exception, since she was Janet all along, and even then her Real name of Camille came up</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 02:24</strong></p>
<p>Any more background on researcher Hanford? Any way she might be connected to Hyles or the others we have already confirmed?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:25</strong></p>
<p>Also, what are the Pronouns for Mann and Khan? Need to narrow down our search</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:25</strong></p>
<p>No connection that I know of.&nbsp; She works in Alchemy or with alchemy and that's all I really know.</p>
<p>No pronouns were used for them</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:26</strong></p>
<p>So we're blind, still. This could be tricky</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:28</strong></p>
<p>We didn't get this far in one interval.&nbsp; It'll take time.&nbsp; We just have to get ahead of whatever UMAD is planning.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:29</strong></p>
<p>Fair, but we will need to move quickly, given they'll be making their next move very soon</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 02:32</strong></p>
<p>They said within an interval so this should be interesting</p>
<p>Also weird hearing Meer Soot's name come up again, head of engineering and mad-scientist-type. If they're using the method of random selection used by him then that just seems to point more towards the idea that they're gathering more people to experiment with, just like we already know about with them mentioning Shades.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:32</strong></p>
<p>Maybe I should look into the whimsy some more while we are waiting on more documents form Culture.&nbsp; Or maybe there is something else I can do?</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 02:32</strong></p>
<p>Maybe they'll ask Shades recruit people from his fanbase</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 02:33</strong></p>
<p>I agree, we need a bit more information on CO before we can pin them down after all</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:33</strong></p>
<p>In that case maybe we should promote more recruits in the meantime.&nbsp; It beats anything they might do...forcefully</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:33</strong></p>
<p>So you want us to bring more people in here?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:34</strong></p>
<p>That would imply I HAVE a Fanbase. I'm less than 1000 subs atm</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:34</strong></p>
<p>Subs?</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 02:34</strong></p>
<p>Hey! Even a small fanbase is still a fanbase</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 02:34</strong></p>
<p>Peach, i definitely think hanging around the whimsey is good. Never know what youll find.</p>
<p>Subs means subscribers. People that have tuned in to the broadcast enough to seek to be notified on the next broadcasts release</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 02:35</strong></p>
<p>It's a number by which YouTubers judge their worth. It's actually kinda become rather pointless in recent times</p>
<p>I like Butchers explanation better tbh</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:36</strong></p>
<p>Broadcast?</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 02:36</strong></p>
<p>Things like the video Shades shared earlier</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 02:36</strong></p>
<p>What about Planar, didn't we need more info on the mission?</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 02:36</strong></p>
<p>I was avoiding video, thought broadcast would make more sense... the next performance might be a good word</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 02:37</strong></p>
<p>I thought we opted to focus on cultural with the janet/cami-cat revelation</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:37</strong></p>
<p>Hear me out on this...&nbsp; What if TheShades mentioned the project to his subs?&nbsp; He can't recruit but if he made himself valuable to UMAD or at least APPEAR to be useful to UMAD they might cool down their investigation of him as a cultural expert.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:38</strong></p>
<p>Guess I got a Video to make now.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:38</strong></p>
<p>I don't know how difficult these performances are.</p>
<p>It wouldn't be too terribly time consuming and expensive would it?</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 02:39</strong></p>
<p>Depends on the type of performer. It can be. But i dont know shades process</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 02:39</strong></p>
<p>Depends on the performance:sweat_smile:</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:39</strong></p>
<p>Nah. Shouldn't take long at all. Should I wait till they ask, or just make one as soon as possible?</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 02:39</strong></p>
<p>We got more names to research from it and I think it's crucial to know more about this AR tool that they're going to use.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:40</strong></p>
<p>I think as soon as possible is best.&nbsp; Don't wait for them to ask.&nbsp; On one hand you appear to be recruiting, on the other you give additional attention they weren't expecting.&nbsp; That unexpected variable is the kind of thing that could have them call off the hounds as it were so they can wait and watch.</p>
<p>Should I move the quill from Culture or let it go through the night?</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 02:42</strong></p>
<p>I worry if you move the quill too often itll draw suspension.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:43</strong></p>
<p>Maybe...&nbsp; Moving it or leaving it can both be risky.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 02:43</strong></p>
<p>Maybe. Although Snow does raise a good point about needing more info on Planar</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:43</strong></p>
<p>It should go without saying to not compromise this side of things in your broadcast.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 02:44</strong></p>
<p>Simply put, I don't think we want to be caught to off guard by the next objective</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 02:44</strong></p>
<p>Either culture or planar is fine for me honestly, I just wanted to point out. I'm heading off for a little bit for a family dinner, brb later</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:44</strong></p>
<p>Brb?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:45</strong></p>
<p>Be Right Back</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 02:45</strong></p>
<p>Fair... we can leave it over night in Planar to learn more before the next letter from umad, then after its dropped go back to cultural?</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 02:45</strong></p>
<p>Sorry, short for 'be right back'</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:45</strong></p>
<p>Understood.&nbsp; Enjoy.</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 02:46</strong></p>
<p>We use a form of shorthand in text communications in informal settings. Though maybe we should see this as a formal one given your focus on etiquette and professionalism.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:47</strong></p>
<p>Ok, so I made a Script for the Video I plan to make, but let me run it by you guys:</p>
<p>Hey guys, Shades here.</p>
<p>So Recently I've been participating in something called Project Grindstone. I'm not exactly sure as to what it's about, but It seems to be a Research project, where we need to solve Ciphers to progress. What I do know is that plenty of Musicians and Voice Actors are involved, such as Caleb Hyles, Cami-Cat, AnnaPantsu, Lizzie Freeman, aka LizzieBiz, and Sean Chiplock, among many others.</p>
<p>But we're gonna need all the help we can get to solve these ciphers. So if you're interested in helping out, head over to projectgrindstone.net and sign up. If the first mission is any indication, things are about to get very interesting, so you don't wanna miss out.</p>
<p>So sign up today, and then join the Discord Server, so you can be ready for the next mission.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 02:48</strong></p>
<p>I like that. One thing though</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 02:48</strong></p>
<p>Wow that was fast.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 02:48</strong></p>
<p>I wouldn't mention Cami or Sean. Especially neither have actually been confirmed</p>
<p>That might send up a flag no?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:48</strong></p>
<p>Brandon has a point.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:49</strong></p>
<p>Cami's in the Server, and anyone who knows sean's twitch channel will recognize it. I should be fine.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 02:49</strong></p>
<p>If you're sure then. I trust your judgement</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:50</strong></p>
<p>I'll add the line "or at the very least are participating as well" to make it less obvious</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:50</strong></p>
<p>If you say so.&nbsp; At the very least I can now know what they are talking about between departments.&nbsp; I think we should have at least a majority of you guys agree though.</p>
<p>Butcher?&nbsp; Chuck?</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 02:51</strong></p>
<p>Butcher seems to be offline</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:51</strong></p>
<p>He's often Invisible, meaning he can be online, but appear offline.</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 02:53</strong></p>
<p>Sorry, sidetracked. Trying to multitask.&nbsp; Hmm. I see merit to both sides. I definitely think the plausible deniability of 'are participating' helps. If you are going to mention cami-janet and sean then work that line in for sure</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 02:54</strong></p>
<p>I think the script is good Shades, I don't think the extra names should be a problem since Cami has joined and Sean's twitch is pretty recognisable, it can be argued to be just discord insider information if we end up getting questions about it.</p>
<p>Given that UMAD has said the next stages of recruitment could be within the next interval, I say we go for Planar since it means we can get insight into what those stages are, with my second choice being going for Cultural so that overall we've spread ourselves across multiple departments and we can see what they might be saying to each other.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:55</strong></p>
<p>Alright, I'll get to work. I'll easily have something ready before long. Might even be done tonight, and release it tomorrow</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:56</strong></p>
<p>I'll move the quill to Planar then and see what the night provides.&nbsp; Meanwhile I'll go for drinks at the Whimsy.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 02:57</strong></p>
<p>Have fun, let us know if you see anyone we should know about</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 02:57</strong></p>
<p>Have a pleasant evening Peach</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:57</strong></p>
<p>Same to you.</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 02:57</strong></p>
<p>Take care, stay safe</p>
<p>What was it you said? May your walls be salted?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:58</strong></p>
<p>Yes, and floors damp.</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 02:58</strong></p>
<p>You'll have to explain that sometime.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 03:56</strong></p>
<p>It is done. The Video will release tomorrow Morning, hopefully beating UMAD to the punch with their next step</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 15:00</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8g1yiWoHXk"><u>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8g1yiWoHXk</u></a></p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 15:02</strong></p>
<p>It looks great! Good job! Hopefully this will bring more applicants in like UMAD wanted.</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 15:49</strong></p>
<p>'Only 2 channels' 'no idea what doublelock is' ugghh i hate feigning ignorance lol</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 15:50</strong></p>
<p>Right? It's so hard to keep hush about what we know. But it'll pay off in the end</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 15:50</strong></p>
<p>For sure</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 15:51</strong></p>
<p>Ikr it's really annoying but it's what we have to do</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 15:52</strong></p>
<p>One step at a time</p>
<p>Now to see if umad smacks them for unauthorized posting i guess</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 15:53</strong></p>
<p>I have a small idea btw, I think the title for the updates channel might be the tree that appears everywhere on the website</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 15:54</strong></p>
<p>Hmm maybe. I can kinda see it</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 15:57</strong></p>
<p>Speaking of, Peach whenever you see this can you tell us if you have any idea what that tree might be? It's gotten us creeped out before and it appears everywhere, even in the profile picture of UMAD-MANAGEMENT</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 17:27</strong></p>
<p>Hello everyone!</p>
<p><strong>Sir Gruffles — Today at 17:27</strong></p>
<p>Good morning!</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 17:27</strong></p>
<p>Morning</p>
<p>Well, Afternoon for me</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 17:27</strong></p>
<p>Hrm...&nbsp; It looks like a tree from a weird.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 17:28</strong></p>
<p>Good evening, how was your night at the Whimsy?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 17:28</strong></p>
<p>There are so many weirds though.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 17:28</strong></p>
<p>What's a weird?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 17:29</strong></p>
<p>Not going to lie, I think I had a little too much to drink.&nbsp; The performance was.. unavoidable.&nbsp; They came off the stage and tried to pull patrons on the stage.&nbsp; I was one of only about eight there.&nbsp; Refusal was met with actors just staring at you.&nbsp; It was uncomfortable.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 17:30</strong></p>
<p>Oof... Yeah, that can happen here too. Still, were you able to see anyone there of interest?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 17:31</strong></p>
<p>A weird is a wooded area that is..weird?&nbsp; I don't know how else to describe it.&nbsp; Weirds can have extra planar influence, they could have a wooded blight, they could have a large population of undead.&nbsp; There are several things that can make a weird.&nbsp; Hell there is a weird where several trees have painted stories.</p>
<p>Weirds are best to be avoided.&nbsp; There are people in culture who are experts on them however.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 17:32</strong></p>
<p>Ok, I can get the gist from that. It's a Forest that has been warped, mostly by Planar Influence.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 17:33</strong></p>
<p>Not necessarily, but it can be.</p>
<p>I saw that Chiplock character again.&nbsp; Came in pretty late.&nbsp; Said he was tired from the stream.&nbsp; I want to investigate where the Stream might be but I haven't found anything in reference so I was going to look into it using the google tool soon.&nbsp; He seemed very familiar with the Blue Banner though, that and they actually ignored him.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 17:38</strong></p>
<p>I can help. He was likely doing a Live Broadcast, which is called a Stream, since we stream the video across the network. Let me check something</p>
<p>Sure enough, he did run a stream last night. He was live for close to Four Hours, which can easily wear someone out like that</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 17:40</strong></p>
<p>Later he hopped the bar and picked something up from the kitchen.&nbsp; A small box with nothing distinguishing about it.&nbsp; A few people were griping that he was getting food from the kitchen.&nbsp; Now everyone thinks you get served only if you're a regular.</p>
<p>An actor tried to take it but he just gave a sharp look and said "Whose your favorite playwriter" and then they just froze there.</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 17:42</strong></p>
<p>Huh, thats weird.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 17:43</strong></p>
<p>There was likely a pickup. Safe to assume it wasn't Food in that box</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 17:43</strong></p>
<p>Uh guys, derpasherpa just got all ominous in general</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 17:44</strong></p>
<p>I just saw that.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 17:45</strong></p>
<p>Artifacts of aetherial programming can have artifacts to their artifacts.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 17:45</strong></p>
<p>Update on Hyles: I just heard back, and he's confrimed our meetup on the 24th. It's happening for sure now.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 17:46</strong></p>
<p>When was that sent?</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 17:46</strong></p>
<p>Awesome Shades! That’ll be a good time</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 17:47</strong></p>
<p>If youre refering to derpa, minutes ago</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 17:47</strong></p>
<p>If you mean Hyles, it was less than 20 Mins ago</p>
<p>But I suggest we keep an eye on our E-mails and DMs. Somethings coming soon</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 17:48</strong></p>
<p>For sure. Peach have you had a chance to check the quill?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 17:48</strong></p>
<p>Oh!&nbsp; Also got a look into the kitchen, didn't see the chef but I saw another guy there.</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 17:49</strong></p>
<p>Oh?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 17:49</strong></p>
<p>Not yet, I think I'll grab it then some Orzo.</p>
<p>They look familiar.</p>
<p>Looked like one of your kind but I don't remember where I've seen them.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 17:50</strong></p>
<p>Any features about them stand out?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 17:52</strong></p>
<p>Short curly brown hair and a goatee?&nbsp; pronounced freckle on the left cheek?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 17:53</strong></p>
<p>We'd need to know which of the Agents it was, then we could narrow our search better. That Freckle will be a Massive clue once we do, however</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 17:53</strong></p>
<p>Hang on</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 17:53</strong></p>
<p>You got an idea?</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 17:54</strong></p>
<p>Yea I was browsing through general last night. I completely spaced on a thing I found though, I was so tired.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 17:55</strong></p>
<p>?</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 17:55</strong></p>
<p>Around mid july another VA joined. Chris Okawa</p>

<p><strong>Peach — Today at 17:55</strong></p>
<p>I'm gonna need a larger picture</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 17:55</strong></p>
<p>CRAP! That HAS To be CO!</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 17:55</strong></p>
<p>That'll work</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 17:55</strong></p>
<p>Was this the guy, peach?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 17:55</strong></p>
<p>That's the one…</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 17:56</strong></p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 17:56</strong></p>
<p>YES! Good one, Butcher!</p>
<p>HE was on the list of possible candidates, but I ruled him out for some reason. Bad Call on my part</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 17:57</strong></p>
<p>Exciting.&nbsp; I'm going to have a celebratory wake up drink.&nbsp; Maybe Kadmin will start loving me again soon.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 17:57</strong></p>
<p>Kadmin?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 17:57</strong></p>
<p>The big red ball in the sky?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 17:58</strong></p>
<p>Oh, so your version of what we call a Sun</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 17:58</strong></p>
<p>Your equivalent of what we call a Sun I take it?</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 17:58</strong></p>
<p>Or as I lovingly refer to it as: the cursed day moon</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 17:58</strong></p>
<p>Although if it’s red…hmm</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 17:58</strong></p>
<p>Does Sun hate inebriates too?</p>
<p>I like that, Kadmin is most certainly a day moon.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 17:59</strong></p>
<p>Um our Sun is not discriminate</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 17:59</strong></p>
<p>The sun isnt a living entity but people suffering from a hangover certainly find it abrasive</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 17:59</strong></p>
<p>It's just a Large ball of GAsses in Space</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 17:59</strong></p>
<p>I believe my humor was lost.&nbsp; I'm going to drink away the drinking pain from last night with Orzo.&nbsp; I'll be back.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 18:00</strong></p>
<p>Drinking pain, or as we call it: a Hangover</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:54</strong></p>
<p>Got some paper and some Orzo.</p>
<p>Now to look through these.</p>
<p>I went to Culture at first because I forgot it was moved to Planar.&nbsp; Sorry that took so long.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 18:56</strong></p>
<p>No worries</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:59</strong></p>
<p>Looks like mission two is being divided up into two sections.&nbsp; Some of the researchers plan to be more active an interval following the release of the next mission.</p>
<p>The exploratory tool they are using is being filtered through a medium you have in your world.&nbsp; They are using something called minecraft.&nbsp; This allows for safe and effective exploration while shielding the reality of their planar exploration through a game element.&nbsp; It's a minor but effective form of deception.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 19:02</strong></p>
<p>Lol Minecraft huh</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 19:03</strong></p>
<p>Huh. Well, if there was any game to use, thatd be one of the better ones based on popularity…</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 19:04</strong></p>
<p>Good thing I got that then. This should be interesting</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 19:04</strong></p>
<p>This is not their only intended medium.&nbsp; I myself know how to set up these tools but I don't have the proper equipment.&nbsp; Should extra planar exploration be necessary in the future but safely.</p>
<p><strong>Sir Gruffles — Today at 19:05</strong></p>
<p>Oh jeez, Minecraft? I think I have that medium...but never actually interacted with it…</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 19:06</strong></p>
<p>I never actually bought minecraft... I'll see about buying it. Or maybe I'll borrow a friends account lol</p>
<p><strong>Sir Gruffles — Today at 19:11</strong></p>
<p>Let's wait and see what the other medium is. I am not the biggest fan of the Minecraft plane, and would greatly appreciate a different Plane lol</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 19:12</strong></p>
<p>It looks like you'll be collecting characters to find the solution to this next mission.&nbsp; I think it is their intention to find how much collaboration and organization is possible as a secondary result of the application process.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 19:12</strong></p>
<p>I can use minecraft fairly decently, I'm interested in seeing what else they'll be using</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 19:12</strong></p>
<p>If need be, I can help guide us through. I'm pretty versed in Minecraft. Was just playing it myself a bit ago.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 19:13</strong></p>
<p>What kind of characters?</p>
<p><strong>Sir Gruffles — Today at 19:13</strong></p>
<p>I'm updating my equipment to launch into that plane.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 19:14</strong></p>
<p>It just says characters.</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 19:14</strong></p>
<p>We should probably collab outside of the minecraft plane so its not obvious we already work together</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 19:15</strong></p>
<p>I wouldn't worry, odds are they know we've at least talked already. We should be fine</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 19:15</strong></p>
<p>"Planar exploration will be delayed to phase three, for the applicants part two of mission two, to properly clean residual undesired elements."</p>
<p><strong>Sir Gruffles — Today at 19:16</strong></p>
<p>Wow. Undesired because I don't like Minecraft? I'm insulted!</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 19:16</strong></p>
<p>They must need to setup the plane. Might want to explain what Minecraft is for Peach. I'm in my car now, or I'd do it myself</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 19:16</strong></p>
<p>Guess I'm getting washed away later....lol</p>
<p><strong>Sir Gruffles — Today at 19:17</strong></p>
<p>I'm assuming the first part will be the recruitment drive, followed by a cipher?</p>
<p>And that Cipher might lead to the Minecraft world seed?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 19:18</strong></p>
<p>Or a link to a map dowload</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 19:18</strong></p>
<p>I'm not certain.&nbsp; When they are discussing undesired elements it usually means they are trying to hide something.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 19:19</strong></p>
<p>Using a minecraft server would mean people may be able to sabotage each other. I know they want us to be competitive but I doubt they want us at each other's virtual throats</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 19:22</strong></p>
<p>Likely not yet..&nbsp; I wouldn't put it past them.&nbsp; They might be stress testing your interpersonal relationships at some point if not now.</p>
<p>Minecraft isn't a plane of exploration but a tool by which to mask the plane being explored.&nbsp; I don't know enough about minecraft to say why they would select this tool as a medium.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 19:23</strong></p>
<p>Good luck with that. My relationships are my business</p>
<p>We'll just have to wait and see what happens</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 19:24</strong></p>
<p>I mean of course the interpersonal relationships of those involved in the application process and those assisting the applicants.</p>
<p><strong>Sir Gruffles — Today at 19:24</strong></p>
<p>Interesting. Well, as soon as my internet stops being a butt, I can update my connections to that tool's systems.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 19:25</strong></p>
<p>Still going through the planar notes.&nbsp; Seems like a lot happened last night.&nbsp; I just hope I can get through everything before I'm expected to work today.</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 19:26</strong></p>
<p>Wow looks like moving the quill was the right call</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 19:35</strong></p>
<p>Lots of arguing about deadlines.&nbsp; Planar seems pretty disorganized but that makes sense.&nbsp; What doesn't make sense to me is there shouldn't be anyone these messages are going to.</p>
<p>Someone seems active in the department head office though...</p>
<p>Looks like they are actively investigating a couple of the people on the discord however.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 19:40</strong></p>
<p>Any clues as to who?</p>
<p>The ones being investigated, I mean</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 19:43</strong></p>
<p>Well, based on the previous communications we've uncovered...it seems pretty clear that they are likely looking into Shades</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 19:48</strong></p>
<p>He isn't wrong about the shades but there are others.</p>
<p>I think it's safe to say that these people are not researchers.</p>
<p>Tanyatheshydragoness, Argent, AnimusCustodius, GayBird, Kenzie Mayne, and Pumpkin Ice.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 19:51</strong></p>
<p>They've all been relatively active, Pumpkin Ice has not but she is researcher Hyles' wife</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 19:51</strong></p>
<p>Why would they be looking into Kara?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 19:52</strong></p>
<p>Leslie is also mentioned but they mention disappointment.&nbsp; I believe it is related to them sharing the information.</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 19:52</strong></p>
<p>Im not sure if its good or bad that the rest of us arent on the list of people of interest</p>
<p>We want to make waves and be impressive but not draw too much attention. Such a tightrope</p>
<p><strong>Sir Gruffles — Today at 19:52</strong></p>
<p>I'm almost saddened that I'm not a person of interest.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 19:53</strong></p>
<p>It might be worth noting that Kenzie's bio reads "voice actress"</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 19:54</strong></p>
<p>Hmmm another one.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 19:55</strong></p>
<p>They can only look into so many and who knows their criteria.&nbsp; It would make sense that Hyle's wife is being looked at if he is a recent addition to UMAD although recent is a relative term.&nbsp; Due to limited resources Culture might only recently be using Planar to do proper security checks.</p>
<p>Chuck seems to be a favorite and The Shades seems to be someone they want to abduct last we checked.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 19:56</strong></p>
<p>Yeah well I don't think Kara is up to anything. As I said, she's not really active on discord anyway</p>
<p>Really? They like Chuck huh?</p>
<p>Oh right UMAD messaged him. But they also messaged Snow didn't they? Hmm</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 19:58</strong></p>
<p>Ah, I forgot about Snow being reached out to.</p>
<p>It's almost like they are looking into as many people as they can.&nbsp; It can only happen so fast though.</p>
<p>Their own application system is working against them though as they have to proceed.&nbsp; Also we are working pretty fast ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 20:00</strong></p>
<p>True</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:01</strong></p>
<p>A moment, my research project team leader needs to talk.&nbsp; Probably more busy work…</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:55</strong></p>
<p>Ok, Finally back home. I'm still confused as to how I got their attention. I'm not that well known or popular, yet they want me specifically. While I appreciated finally being noticed, I don't quite want any attention that will lead to trouble.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 20:56</strong></p>
<p>Well, you're the cameraman for Metrocon. And you have been talking about how you plan to interview Caleb. Which I may add, this wouldn't be the first time</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:57</strong></p>
<p>I guess maybe he mentioned me, especially since I just met up with him at Metrocon, so it'd be fresh in his mind. Still, never expected it would lead to this.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 20:58</strong></p>
<p>It is what it is</p>
<p>Caleb aside, you also have been pretty active in regards to the cyphers. I mean you figured out the monk thing. That's impressive</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 22:51</strong></p>
<p>Work, work, work</p>
<p>I'm back</p>
<p>Performance review and another stack of things to do.&nbsp; No sleep tonight.</p>
<p>I have some big news though.&nbsp; Planar docs suggest a means to request the proper clearance paperwork.&nbsp; I think we might stand a chance to create a new clearance doc as long it's during a transition of power within the Planar department.&nbsp; One is coming up but I don't think we have any real time to use it.&nbsp; Also they would be able to find a redundancy which would put UMAD on a higher alert.&nbsp; If we want access to personnel files we should careful plan when we do it.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 22:59</strong></p>
<p>We're gonna have to think on this. We need to know what the best time would be, but with how random things seems to be in that department, we might not have a clear timeframe.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 23:21</strong></p>
<p>Understandable.</p>
<p>Planes signaled Infernal Affairs to call some people who previous contacted them.&nbsp; UMAD is waiting for either late tonight or the first to address this in chat to announce the next mission.</p>
<p>Planes seems to be having a number of messages coming from Alchemy at this time.&nbsp; Necromancy seems to have lightened up quite a bit on security probably due to increased work load on your admissions.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 23:32</strong></p>
<p>Is there anything else from Planar that we would need to know at this time? Honestly, knowing Minecraft is the next part of the test is a HUGE help. We'll know where to concentrate on. I'm thinking that it's going to be constructs or devices or something on your side that we'll be controlling and moving around in your world while to us it's a game.</p>
<p>Btw I'm back from work so I'm ready to help!</p>
<p>And if that is the case, we may be able to actually meet up with you Peach.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 23:44</strong></p>
<p>Maybe, I have a theory I'd like to apply to transmit a virtual awareness but I'm not sure what medium will work.&nbsp; I'll need to find a plane that has been previously explored by UMAD that is designated safe but also no longer permitting active travel.&nbsp; That way I can find a compatible medium to explore there and we won't be interrupted by UMAD.&nbsp; I would need more equipment to do that as well though.</p>
<p>I'm still skimming the planar notes but I need to keep up with my other work to avoid losing my position here.&nbsp; I might have to leave again soon.&nbsp; It looks though that the next mission has help from Culture and Planar but is nearly entirely designed by Necromancy.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 23:49</strong></p>
<p>Makes sense. Necromancy could make the world in Minecraft, but Planar and Culture could setup the cipher for them to add to it.</p>

<p>Damnit...&nbsp; I have more work.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Yesterday at 23:51</strong></p>
<p>Have fun…</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 23:51</strong></p>
<p>Cataloging materials... again…</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Yesterday at 23:58</strong></p>
<p>So We just dug around the Gridnstone Website, and Realized there's an image that might worth knowing about. Is this a city from your realm?</p>
