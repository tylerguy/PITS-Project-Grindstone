<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:10</strong></p>
<p>I hate rats.&nbsp; I'm back everyone.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 02:11</strong></p>
<p>Welcome back! Have you been well?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:13</strong></p>
<p>Exhausted.&nbsp; grabbed what I could not long ago from Necromancy and took the quill.&nbsp; Security has increased again.&nbsp; Not long after the rat incident a few found their way into my room and destroyed some of my equipment.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 02:15</strong></p>
<p>Aw that's terrible! Glad they didn't get you though.</p>
<p>I guess next in line for discussion is what you found from necromancy and where to move the quill to next.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:27</strong></p>
<p>First, it seems like the bulk of the next round of recruitment will begin in two intervals.&nbsp; I learned that plane is being "made appropriate" for continued use after your application process.</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 02:28</strong></p>
<p>two intervals?</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 02:28</strong></p>
<p>Two days for us</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 02:28</strong></p>
<p>oh k</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:31</strong></p>
<p>It seems like they also assisted infernal affairs recently with attempting to destroy a large number of files.&nbsp; This is fairly unusual for UMAD.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 02:31</strong></p>
<p>Oof it makes one wonder what's on those files</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 02:31</strong></p>
<p>Guess they have things they want to keep really secret</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 02:32</strong></p>
<p>Yeah</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 02:32</strong></p>
<p>Is there any way to get any of the files that's being destroyed?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:32</strong></p>
<p>how Destroyed we talking here?</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 02:32</strong></p>
<p>like time machine bad or what?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:35</strong></p>
<p>In all departments information is either redacted or is made in error still allowed to be kept very visible to see where error was made.&nbsp; This is usually by simply running a line through text.&nbsp; In this case they attempted to destroy many files including many of a higher clearance.&nbsp; Higher clearance items aren't very easy to destroy, while some lower clearance items might simply be written on parchment and can be burned higher clearance documents often have means of easy location should they be stolen.&nbsp; This is typically aetherial in nature which would require dispelling.&nbsp; Even so auras remain persistent in a weaker state for some time.&nbsp; This is very important for investigations when a caster is involved since everyone typically has their own unique aetherial signature.&nbsp; It's a sort of style unique to them and their casting.&nbsp; Sometimes a particular shortcut they might use etc.</p>
<p>If these were destroyed then they haven't been entirely destroyed yet.&nbsp; They were likely destroyed in the in the lead room.&nbsp; Recovery is possible but would be tricky and the lead room degrades auras quickly.&nbsp; This means we might be able to create impressions of the partial documents through a combination aeonization and divination magics.&nbsp; The documents would be illegible in their current state but with enough effort we might be able to find something useful in them.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:39</strong></p>
<p>Then let's do it! If they're trying to get rid of it, there's a reason for it</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 02:39</strong></p>
<p>sounds doable</p>
<p>tricky but doable</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 02:39</strong></p>
<p>Hey I'm willing to try and help decipher any new information that comes this way</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 02:39</strong></p>
<p>Same</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 02:40</strong></p>
<p>Must be super important in some way or another so I'm down</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:40</strong></p>
<p>Cracks Knuckles Time to Crack some Codes</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 02:41</strong></p>
<p>it's time to build up.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:41</strong></p>
<p>This is where things get tricky...&nbsp; The lead room is used for higher clearance documents like the personnel files that went missing.&nbsp; We have no idea how much time we really have and the longer we take the more the files will fade away and we will have less to work with.&nbsp; I would need to find a way into the higher clearance room or have a new clearance document made for me.&nbsp; Then even if I make it in I'd need a considerable amount of time to record as many impressions as possible without being caught.&nbsp; Finally, once I have the impressions it would not be like a cipher, these would be incomplete documents and might require some ingenuity to recover fully.&nbsp; Even then some of the files may be redacted.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:43</strong></p>
<p>It's a risk, but I get the sense that this is too important to not do. We have to decide fast: Is this worth that big a risk?</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 02:43</strong></p>
<p>i say yes</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 02:43</strong></p>
<p>I think it is. Kinda like with necromancy, now is the best time</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 02:44</strong></p>
<p>it's tricky but as the shades said it's too important.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:44</strong></p>
<p>I had they key made but it came with a little trouble.&nbsp; My guy I thought would go without asking questions, it's just a simple key.&nbsp; He knows I work at UMAD and is suspicious.&nbsp; I'm worried he might be a problem later too.&nbsp; He did seem to suggest that he might need additional insurance in the future…</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 02:45</strong></p>
<p>oh boy.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:45</strong></p>
<p>The planar head is already installed.&nbsp; Do we place the quill and wait for them to be cycled out again or do we look for another way?</p>
<p>Also, how do we buy time?&nbsp; Also, also we don't know how a few of the departments are involved yet.</p>
<p>We really need to plan where our resources are going.</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 02:46</strong></p>
<p>True</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 02:47</strong></p>
<p>What's the side effect of those potions you got? The one that heightens intelligence.</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 02:48</strong></p>
<p>he's gone</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 02:48</strong></p>
<p>Well, rats got to the equipment. They could have in and out connection because of it.</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 02:49</strong></p>
<p>True</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 03:03</strong></p>
<p>Also peach, just to remind me, you did get a high clearance key of some kind right now right? Could we use that to get to the lead room with less problems and get a new one with the new planar head?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:02</strong></p>
<p>I think everything is fixed now.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 18:03</strong></p>
<p>Good to know. We got a lot to discuss today, given what you told us last night</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:05</strong></p>
<p>I'll try to answer all I can.&nbsp; Do you want me to talk in the PITS chat or here?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 18:06</strong></p>
<p>Wait what? Do you have access to that?</p>
<p><span class="text-big"><mark class="pen-red"><strong>[Peach moves to PITS server]</strong></mark></span></p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 18:10</strong></p>
<p>So I believe we need to discuss what to do with Planar, and the Due to be destroyed documents.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 18:26</strong></p>
<p>How risky would acquiring these documents be? And remember they would probably be in pieces</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:35</strong></p>
<p>Well...it's complicated.</p>
<p>The longer we wait the more they will degrade but I cannot make it into the lead room without proper clearance.&nbsp; That would be the first step.</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Today at 18:37</strong></p>
<p>would you be able to get that from janet's desk?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:38</strong></p>
<p>Infernal affairs will recognize me as whichever entity I hold the clearance for.&nbsp; They are some of the most impersonal personnel here.&nbsp; They are however pretty good at determining a fake.&nbsp; The extent we would need to go through to forge the item makes me believe we ought to go through channels to acquire someone else's.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 18:39</strong></p>
<p>I see, "Borrow" someone else's Clearance, so even if they do check to see who accessed it, it would be someone else taking the fall instead of you. Have anyone who you think would work?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:39</strong></p>
<p>+Unlikely.&nbsp; I do have information on how to acquire one as a department head thanks to our previous work but doing so would put us at risk.&nbsp; As soon as the department head attempts to use their higher clearance they will learn it does not work and that a new clearance was made.&nbsp; The best way to hide this is to request clearance while awaiting an incoming department head or to steal their clearance paperwork.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 18:41</strong></p>
<p>If we waited till the Head left, it might be too late, since they'll likely be starting the next phase tomorrow. We'll need to find a safe way to steal their paperwork now</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:41</strong></p>
<p>There isn't exactly a directory I can access without being a member of Admin or Infernal Affairs as to who has what level clearance.&nbsp; &nbsp; There are some who advertise their higher clearance but for the most part it is kept private.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 18:42</strong></p>
<p>For good reason.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:43</strong></p>
<p>Even with this clearance I could still be discovered if someone walked in on me.&nbsp; Also copying the documents would require appropriate tools which I'd need to acquire at aetherial studies.</p>
<p>This means I need to buy more time and I don't think rats will work in this instance.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 18:45</strong></p>
<p>So much to do, and not enough time to do it. We need to make a Plan and fast. I'll admit I'm a bit worried, knowing I'm likely in danger of being captured soon. I want to do what I can to either Prevent that, or to make sure the gears are in motion after it happens.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:46</strong></p>
<p>As long as accounting finds you are more useful left alone then you'll be fine.</p>
<p>Their word is very important for most decision making here.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 18:46</strong></p>
<p>True, but that'll only last so long, based on that message, so I'm taking no chances here</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:47</strong></p>
<p>What would you suggest to acquire the proper clearance?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 18:49</strong></p>
<p>This is where I falter here. I'm not the best with thinking on the Fly. If someone starts an Idea, I'm usually good of bouncing off of that, but trying to think from square one is where my Creativity tends to struggle, since I overthink a lot (I have a Mental Condition that causes my brain to be hyperactive). And worse yet, few of the others are on to give suggestions.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 18:51</strong></p>
<p>Didn't you mention earlier that you thought you had the resources to make a clearance document?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:51</strong></p>
<p>We could wait for the next planar head but we do not know how long that'll take.&nbsp; We might lose some important information but we should also consider taking some loses if necessary.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 18:53</strong></p>
<p>Wait a second I have an idea, would Researcher Hyles have the proper clearance?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:53</strong></p>
<p>To acquire, yes.&nbsp; It would require me using someone else's clearance.&nbsp; For instance, I could have a new clearance documents be issued to me but for the new head of the planar department.&nbsp; This would only be good until another replacement is requisitioned.&nbsp; Once a replacement is requisitioned the old clearance document becomes invalid.&nbsp; That's why the transition of department heads seemed like a good opportunity.&nbsp; If I did this while one was installed it would be very risky.</p>
<p>I don't have high enough clearance.&nbsp; I don't know about Researcher Hyles.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 18:55</strong></p>
<p>I was wondering because if he does then we could use the same tactic as we've done with Janet and you could try and grab something from his desk like a form of ID while he livestreams over in this plane.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 18:56</strong></p>
<p>Sounds like our best bet is to wait for now, even if means losing those destroyed docs. I guess I'm a bit Panicky after seeing my Name as a target for experimentation. It's been weighing on my mind a lot, to say the least.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:57</strong></p>
<p>I'm not certain if or where his office might be.&nbsp; I could start at infernal affairs but the inquiry will be recorded.</p>
<p><strong>Eris — Today at 18:58</strong></p>
<p>Is there no way at all getting the documents without clearance?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:59</strong></p>
<p>Maybe we should move the quill around and try to get into Janet's desk next opportunity?&nbsp; Maybe we should take a risk soon?&nbsp; I just worry that I won't be around long if we take too many risks.</p>
<p><strong>Eris — Today at 18:59</strong></p>
<p>I believe we should choose our priorities</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 19:00</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, I think we need to cut our losses and focus on moving the quill. This route of getting clearance comes with too many risks, and we're too early to be taking those kind of chances unless we know it's worth that risk</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 19:01</strong></p>
<p>Walking into the lead room absolutely isn't an option.&nbsp; Moving through by aetherial means is nearly impossible due to the lead.&nbsp; Physically breaking in however might be possible albeit extremely dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 19:02</strong></p>
<p>Hey Peach, question. What are the side effects of those potions?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 19:04</strong></p>
<p>Which, the one on the rats?&nbsp; Unclear, it's all still highly experimental.&nbsp; What I have seen is they are temporary in effect.&nbsp; The intention was to create something to improve fluid intelligence.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 19:06</strong></p>
<p>I agree with Shades. I think we're in the dark overall and moving the quill if nothing else gets us more information regarding the inner workings of UMAD and can tell us when better opportunities come, like when the new head of Planar comes in. At this point it might be too risky to make any larger moves, and moving the quill gets us somewhere rather than potentially getting you caught and the entire operation going pear-shaped.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 19:06</strong></p>
<p>So the question is where to move the quill then</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 19:07</strong></p>
<p>I think we were talking Planar, close to Janet's desk, since a lot is happening there right now.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 19:09</strong></p>
<p>We haven't looked into a few departments but we could always revisit old ones.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 19:11</strong></p>
<p>We're mainly focusing on what is relevant at the moment. Since some of the Departments are on high alert, we need to be careful what we're spying on.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Yesterday at 19:14</strong></p>
<p>Agreed. I say we stay close to Janet. Nothing seems to happen without her noticing so that’s our best bet for intel</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Yesterday at 19:15</strong></p>
<p>So Alchemy is on high alert due to the rats and necromancy has high security anyway. We could maybe learn more on the test if we move to Planar again. What departments are close to Janet's desk? In fact, what is the layout of UMAD that way we can have a clearer view on how to operate. A map would probably be best but you can describe it as well.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 19:19</strong></p>
<p>The UMAD tower has multiple floors.&nbsp; Each research department has a dedicated floor but here is also other reference materials and administrative floors.&nbsp; The ground level has a large door leading to a long hall.&nbsp; On either side are several doors to small lecture rooms or single studies for personal use.&nbsp; At the end of the hall is Janet's desk, in the open.&nbsp; To the right you'll see a stairway leading up and to the left a single door I've only been in once, when I was an applicant.&nbsp; It leads to a stairway heading down into where they conduct physical examinations.&nbsp; The very top floor before the roof is the residence of the Headmaster...I think.&nbsp; Each floor also has small residence for employees and researchers.&nbsp; Each department head has their own office.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Yesterday at 19:21</strong></p>
<p>Wait so does anybody have a home within the city or does every staff member live within UMAD?</p>
<p>Besides maybe people from our plane</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 19:23</strong></p>
<p>Some commute, many live in the city, but several live on site too.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Yesterday at 19:27</strong></p>
<p>Can we know which floors are which departments? It would really help us with planning these out, like where to move the quill and such.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 19:39</strong></p>
<p>First floor is the entrance and HR.&nbsp; Alchemy used to be on the sixth floor but there were complaints and it was moved to the second floor and is now separated from other research departments, Third is infernal affairs and accounting, Fourth is engineering,&nbsp; Fifth is Necromancy, sixth is culture, seventh is also culture due to their size, eighth is planar, ninth is aetherial studies, tenth is an administrative floor, eleventh is storage, everything above that doesn't really matter.&nbsp; There is structure beneath but I've only seen the physical examination room.</p>
<p>I should say there is also storage down below.&nbsp; Large item storage.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Yesterday at 19:42</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, this will definitely help :blush:</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 19:42</strong></p>
<p>Although there is talk of restructuring again in the future.&nbsp; Maybe a few months.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Yesterday at 19:43</strong></p>
<p>As I said before, we need to more about you. Now, you said you can't reveal too much, but there are a couple things we would like to know.</p>
<p>1. What Gender are you? We've been unsure what to refer to you as when discussing things, so what pronouns do you go by?</p>
<p>2. What is you goal with all this? At this point, we're assured UMAD is an issue, but we need to know what your part to play in all this is. Why do you want to investigate all this?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 19:43</strong></p>
<p>Diversifying the departments more.&nbsp; Maybe breaking culture into new departments and reopening religious studies.&nbsp; Nothing to worry about now.&nbsp; It's also just talk at mess.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Yesterday at 19:43</strong></p>
<p>We'll get to that when the time comes. For now I vote the quill either engineering or culture.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Yesterday at 19:44</strong></p>
<p>Why those two Snow?</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Yesterday at 19:45</strong></p>
<p>Both are relatively close to Janet's desk and has low risks due to security. We haven't had anything from engineering so maybe we could find something random that could be helpful or culture to know more about the researchers while the information flow is still heightened.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Yesterday at 19:47</strong></p>
<p>It seems pretty compartmentalized though. I’m not sure we’d gain much from Culture at this stage. On the other hand, I don’t know enough about engineering to make a call. So what do the rest of y’all think?</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Yesterday at 19:49</strong></p>
<p>i agree with snow</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Yesterday at 19:49</strong></p>
<p>I don't know what we could learn from engineering either. Nor Aetherial Studies.</p>
<p>And also, Peach, did Kemist ever reach out to you?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 19:56</strong></p>
<p>The latter should go much without saying but I'll give you the narrative.&nbsp; The UMAD originated years ago after the Ramean Revolution.&nbsp; The revolutionaries won and Rameus' policies created a complete overhaul of the current legal system, the removal of nobility as we understood it, and land reform.&nbsp; The acquisition of land where Dial is presently came with the aggressive removal of the local goblinoids.&nbsp; Samuel was a specialist during the war and used the movement of information to influence relationships with undesirables to assist in the unilateral warfare conducted.&nbsp; Once the land was acquired Ramean policy stated that the government be separated into three separate powers and Rameus limited his own authority.&nbsp; Maybe a little too much was given to intelligence.&nbsp; Intelligence controls much of the national defense budget, military, education now that it is accessible, and public information campaigns. &nbsp; UMAD is an entirely secular entity who considers the religious ideologies and needs within the world but does not conduct action in accordance with the benefit of any faith.&nbsp; As they deemed research necessary they would push legislation through means of aggressive political tactics in court.&nbsp; They may not write the laws but they often control public image of those representing.&nbsp; This has eased up restrictions to allow for more efficient experimentation and research sometimes at the expense of simple citizens.&nbsp; Their methods, while efficient, seem extreme to me.&nbsp; What made me start my work was when the headmaster released an organization policy update and new verbiage for the rules and regulations handbook.&nbsp; It no longer reads in the benefit of Belthas but in the benefit of the material plane.&nbsp; The Headmaster's decision I saw as a meaningful and concerning prospective, my collogues think I'm being over dramatic, reading into it too much.</p>
<p>Yes but Kemist never responded to me.</p>
<p>As for the former question, we have a saying in UMAD.&nbsp; Need to Know.&nbsp; I don't think my gender is relevant.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Yesterday at 20:04</strong></p>
<p>That is honestly quite fair. There are people on our plane who prefer to be guarded about such things as well. Rest assured you’re not obligated to answer if you don’t wish to</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Yesterday at 20:05</strong></p>
<p>We just wanted to check.</p>
<p>Anyway, since Kemist never responded, we're looking at other Candidates for our last spot, but we need to check if they're not involved in anyway.</p>
<p>Did TylerGuy come up in any of the reports we got as being involved?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 20:08</strong></p>
<p>Not that I know of.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Yesterday at 20:08</strong></p>
<p>Ok, I'm gonna contact them and see if their Interested. Since you're now here, I'll go ahead and test them myself, since I know how to do it.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 20:09</strong></p>
<p>So you're looking for one or two more people?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Yesterday at 20:10</strong></p>
<p>Just one more. Gruffles is still on Honeymoon, but they should be back in time, so we only need one more.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Yesterday at 20:16</strong></p>
<p>So the started up on human testing and now you want to find what's actually going on. Which is understandable. What information would be possibly useful if we were to move the quill to engineering or aetherial studies?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 20:19</strong></p>
<p>Other people's involvement for one.&nbsp; We might be able to get information on why the engineering department has no head should we go there.&nbsp; Alchemy seems mostly irrelevant but they are still involved in the project somehow.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Yesterday at 20:20</strong></p>
<p>Ok, Tylerguy passed the test. Bringing them in.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Yesterday at 20:21</strong></p>
<p>Welcome to the PITS!</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Yesterday at 20:21</strong></p>
<p>Than engineering sounds like a good idea</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Yesterday at 20:21</strong></p>
<p>Hello o/</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Yesterday at 20:21</strong></p>
<p>And that was quick Shades! Dang</p>
<p>Welcome</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Yesterday at 20:21</strong></p>
<p>Is Alchemy still super risky from the rats escaping?</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Yesterday at 20:22</strong></p>
<p>I already knew what the message was before I read the hint</p>
<p>Happy to be here, hope I can be of some help to you all</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Yesterday at 20:23</strong></p>
<p>If that decipher speed was anything to say, you will be a great addition lol</p>
<p>Welcome to the team!</p>
<p>I'm still new to learning how to decipher stuff but I'm super good at making connections</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 20:28</strong></p>
<p>It's very secure for the rats.</p>
<p>If anything the rats made things less secure everywhere but the lab they are stored in.</p>
<p>There is a storm, this might effect my connection.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Yesterday at 20:33</strong></p>
<p>Okay then Alchemy would be good if only that one section is on alert. I thought the whole floor was</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 20:36</strong></p>
<p>Many floors are upset by Alchemy's lack of security with the rats but that is all.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Yesterday at 20:40</strong></p>
<p>Then if that's the case, my vote is to move the quill to Alchemy.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Yesterday at 20:44</strong></p>
<p>I'm not so sure. We need to go where we know we can learn something. Right now, alchemy is a crapshoot. We may not find anything there, and we can't afford to chase a red herring right now.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Yesterday at 20:45</strong></p>
<p>I thought Alchemy was having a heavy hand the upcoming test? If we could learn even a smidge more information before then it would be benificial.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Yesterday at 20:46</strong></p>
<p>Can you verify that, Peach? Is alchemy involved at all in the next test?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 20:47</strong></p>
<p>Alchemy is but I'm not certain to what capacity.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Yesterday at 20:48</strong></p>
<p>Ok, the I do think it's worth looking into after all. I agree with checking alchemy</p>
