<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 00:34</strong></p>
<p>Hello all</p>
<p>Janet sent a new E-Mail. They've fired a Warning at us</p>
<p><i>I have also been informed that a certain unnamed individual designated officially as an “undesirable” has been in contact with some of you. Any further interaction we become aware of between applicants and this individual may warrant disciplinary action. We are always watching.</i></p>
<p>@Peach Might want to be aware of this</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:44</strong></p>
<p>I thought as much…</p>
<p><strong>Numbuh 4 — Today at 02:45</strong></p>
<p>Back up plan: buy a Tommy gun /s</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:45</strong></p>
<p>We also think they might use the newbies to smoke us out:</p>
<p><i>You can find these various “missions” on our official website. However, some clues to these “missions” are not on the website. To discover these you must engage with applicants who have been here from the beginning.</i></p>
<p><strong>Numbuh 4 — Today at 02:45</strong></p>
<p>Where did you find that paragraph</p>
<p><strong>ZellaSwiffham — Today at 02:45</strong></p>
<p>in the email</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Today at 02:45</strong></p>
<p>Peach, does this look like Hanford when youve seen them?</p>

<p><strong>Numbuh 4 — Today at 02:47</strong></p>
<p>First or second one</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:48</strong></p>
<p>The new one that just dropped</p>
<p><strong>ZellaSwiffham — Today at 02:48</strong></p>
<p>uhhh i believe the second, more recent, one</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:48</strong></p>
<p>I know that girl.&nbsp; I've seen her several times near my block!</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Today at 02:48</strong></p>
<p>Pog</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 02:48</strong></p>
<p>:eyes:</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:48</strong></p>
<p>WE GOT HER!</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:48</strong></p>
<p>Pog?</p>
<p><strong>ZellaSwiffham — Today at 02:48</strong></p>
<p>well there we go</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Today at 02:49</strong></p>
<p>its a term for celebration</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:49</strong></p>
<p>I see</p>
<p><strong>ZellaSwiffham — Today at 02:49</strong></p>
<p>oh god we are not teaching extraplanar beings Twitch vernacular</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:49</strong></p>
<p>pog then</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:49</strong></p>
<p>This has to be Hanford!</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Today at 02:49</strong></p>
<p>is this the person we know as Hanford?</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 02:49</strong></p>
<p>Lol</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:49</strong></p>
<p>Possibly?</p>
<p>I do know her.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:49</strong></p>
<p>It's something at least!</p>
<p><strong>ZellaSwiffham — Today at 02:49</strong></p>
<p>its a highly likely suspect</p>
<p><strong>Numbuh 4 — Today at 02:49</strong></p>
<p>That’s not completely reassuring</p>
<p>But it’s high probability</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:49</strong></p>
<p>Talked to her once in reference.</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 02:49</strong></p>
<p>who is she</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Today at 02:49</strong></p>
<p>i thought you'd seen Hanford before i wasnt sure.</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Today at 02:50</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/auribug"><u>https://twitter.com/auribug</u></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJFS6lubqFVzNH-S3Z4A96Q"><u>https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJFS6lubqFVzNH-S3Z4A96Q</u></a></p>
<p>singer on YT with 50k subs</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:50</strong></p>
<p>She's another Musician</p>
<p>Makes Sense</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 02:51</strong></p>
<p>i mean to peach</p>
<p>but ok</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Today at 02:51</strong></p>
<p>Ahh</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 02:53</strong></p>
<p>The lead seems be hanford @Peach</p>
<p>we've confirmed it</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:53</strong></p>
<p>Ok, we confirmed it. That's Hanford. She releases a song online: <a href="https://beetlebug.bandcamp.com/releases"><u>https://beetlebug.bandcamp.com/releases</u></a></p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:54</strong></p>
<p>Excellent!</p>
<p>Now if only I could make it to the quill.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:55</strong></p>
<p>Now, if I recall, you said Hanford worked with Khan and Mann. Odds are, we can take this lead and work to find them soon as well</p>
<p><strong>ZellaSwiffham — Today at 02:56</strong></p>
<p>i mean</p>
<p>there is this?</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/amandafagan_/status/1422232042540965896?s=20"><u>https://twitter.com/amandafagan_/status/1422232042540965896?s=20</u></a></p>
<p>its a collab between aurelia and two other singers</p>
<p>happened very recently</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:58</strong></p>
<p>It seems March mentioned the project on YT in some text under a video she announced in her discord today.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:58</strong></p>
<p>We're aware of her promoting it. It's where the influx of new members came from</p>
<p>Her Discord has a LARGE userbase. around 1100 Members.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:59</strong></p>
<p>I see…</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 03:00</strong></p>
<p>Doesn’t mean ALL of them are coming mind you. I would wager no more than a couple hundred at best from there specifically. How many a video might bring….unknown</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 03:03</strong></p>
<p>I've been on lockdown all day, several blocks have been. Also there have been frequent check ins. I think I'll need to move my equipment soon.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 03:04</strong></p>
<p>I see. Stay safe Peach</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 03:04</strong></p>
<p>My apologies on disappearing so frequently and suddenly.</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 03:04</strong></p>
<p>be safe</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 03:04</strong></p>
<p>We understand. Be Safe</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 03:05</strong></p>
<p>I'll probably move it tomorrow.</p>
<p>If they lighten up ever I'll grab the quill notes.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 03:05</strong></p>
<p>We'll likely have plenty of info from them by then. For now, let's not be hasty</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 03:44</strong></p>
<p>Back, the random searches seem over</p>
<p>I got some quill messages</p>
<p><strong>ZellaSwiffham — Today at 03:44</strong></p>
<p>howd it go?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 03:45</strong></p>
<p>Oohh Do tell?</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 03:45</strong></p>
<p>ooohhhh what you get us?</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Today at 03:45</strong></p>
<p>what they said</p>
<p><strong>Numbuh 4 — Today at 03:45</strong></p>
<p>please be free bitcoin</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 03:46</strong></p>
<p>... Really?</p>
<p><strong>GOddman — Today at 03:46</strong></p>
<p>plz be free ethereum</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 03:46</strong></p>
<p>I don't understand</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 03:46</strong></p>
<p>Hahahaha</p>
<p><strong>Numbuh 4 — Today at 03:46</strong></p>
<p>I'm not getting a date, so that's the next best thing</p>
<p>-cries in corner-</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 03:46</strong></p>
<p>Don't worry about it. They're just joking around</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 03:47</strong></p>
<p>O...okay</p>
<p><strong>GOddman — Today at 03:47</strong></p>
<p>so what's the meesage</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 03:47</strong></p>
<p>we are jokers</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 03:47</strong></p>
<p>Looking through them now.</p>
<p>You're starting to sound like scoundrels.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 03:48</strong></p>
<p>It's called Levity. We need a laugh, or we'd lose our minds from all the stuff we deal with</p>
<p><strong>Numbuh 4 — Today at 03:48</strong></p>
<p>If you can't avoid the moles, kill em /j</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 03:48</strong></p>
<p>what shades said</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 03:48</strong></p>
<p>I suppose that is fair.&nbsp; Maybe I'm just losing my sense of humor.&nbsp; Today has been a nightmare.</p>
<p><strong>GOddman — Today at 03:49</strong></p>
<p>especially in the the time that there a lot of sound going on in the grindstone server</p>
<p><strong>Numbuh 4 — Today at 03:49</strong></p>
<p>you don't want to know what I've done the last three days</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 03:49</strong></p>
<p>I can imagine. We all have our bad days. Hell, with what we're dealing with in our world, it feels like it never ends</p>
<p><strong>Numbuh 4 — Today at 03:49</strong></p>
<p>I have done nothing but teleport bread for three days</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 03:49</strong></p>
<p>oh no we need 10 cc of laughter stat</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 03:50</strong></p>
<p>I wish I knew what was happening over there.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 03:50</strong></p>
<p>No... You Really don't....</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 03:50</strong></p>
<p>?</p>
<p><strong>GOddman — Today at 03:50</strong></p>
<p>Oh wait peach how do you not appering to be online in discord?</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 03:50</strong></p>
<p>trust us you don't</p>
<p><strong>Numbuh 4 — Today at 03:50</strong></p>
<p>They're talking about cheese</p>
<p>it's weird</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 03:51</strong></p>
<p>From Political Chaos, to arguments over eveything, to a Virus Ravaging our planet, it's a mess</p>
<p><strong>Numbuh 4 — Today at 03:51</strong></p>
<p>That's life for you</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 03:51</strong></p>
<p>theres chaos and then thereschaos</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Today at 03:51</strong></p>
<p>and also cannibalism was a topic for a while</p>
<p><strong>Numbuh 4 — Today at 03:51</strong></p>
<p>It's all fun and games until you live in Florida</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Today at 03:51</strong></p>
<p>and a lot of cheese talk including reanimation of cheese</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 03:51</strong></p>
<p>DON'T I KNOW IT!</p>
<p><strong>Numbuh 4 — Today at 03:51</strong></p>
<p>oops... sorry bro</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 03:52</strong></p>
<p>It's cool, you didn't know</p>
<p>Besides, I agree</p>
<p><strong>Numbuh 4 — Today at 03:52</strong></p>
<p>my condolences to the 4 teachers that died</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 03:52</strong></p>
<p>"Begin arrangements with Z and have Janet directly address the applicants."</p>
<p><strong>Numbuh 4 — Today at 03:52</strong></p>
<p>even if 3 of them were unvaccinated</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 03:52</strong></p>
<p>Wait... Z?</p>

<p><strong>GOddman — Today at 03:53</strong></p>
<p>maybe a too</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 03:53</strong></p>
<p>It might be a person. Let's see</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 03:53</strong></p>
<p>"Material contribution would stimulate a proof of social as described by Infernal Affairs.&nbsp; Prepare the order and have it distributed for the third applicant mission."</p>
<p><strong>Numbuh 4 — Today at 03:53</strong></p>
<p>the THIRD mission?</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Today at 03:54</strong></p>
<p>Infernal?</p>
<p><strong>Numbuh 4 — Today at 03:54</strong></p>
<p>also i changed my nickname</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 03:54</strong></p>
<p>That's what they call Internal Affairs. I know, it's odd to us</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Today at 03:54</strong></p>
<p>Kk</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 03:55</strong></p>
<p>why the third one</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 03:56</strong></p>
<p>"Verify contribution by Broker Carry within the next interval.&nbsp; Contracts need to be reviewed.&nbsp; The Carry needs to also be set up with a neumann.</p>
<p><strong>Numbuh 4 — Today at 03:56</strong></p>
<p>a... a neumann?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 03:56</strong></p>
<p>Oh lord. There's a lot of new stuff to process here…</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Today at 03:56</strong></p>
<p>Mann is a researcher, right?</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 03:57</strong></p>
<p>peach can you translate that to English for us</p>
<p><strong>Numbuh 4 — Today at 03:57</strong></p>
<p>and Khan</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 03:57</strong></p>
<p>"Mann's contribution has been finalized.&nbsp; Terminate contract until next Hanford assignment but verify with Hanford if we are proceeding with Mann again"</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 03:57</strong></p>
<p>So Mann's part is as needed, not a full researcher</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 03:58</strong></p>
<p>We found Hanford.&nbsp; I have no idea who Mann is or what a Broker Carry is.... or a neumann...</p>
<p>WAIT</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 03:58</strong></p>
<p>???</p>
<p><strong>GOddman — Today at 03:58</strong></p>
<p>we have a lead, right?</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 03:58</strong></p>
<p>whats up peach</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 03:59</strong></p>
<p>"Tell the Broker Carry to begin use of regulation ink.&nbsp; The Orange hurts my eyes."</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 03:59</strong></p>
<p>what</p>
<p>did that say</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 03:59</strong></p>
<p>Does that mean…</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 03:59</strong></p>
<p>oh boy</p>
<p><strong>GOddman — Today at 04:00</strong></p>
<p>is Broker Carry orange?(no actually)</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:00</strong></p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 04:01</strong></p>
<p>Wait... I think they are referring to a broker NAMED Carry</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Today at 04:01</strong></p>
<p>the C's</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:220px;"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/bNhfkX0D5WJDDPOt-dNO9DJFL4g9VLKz-BslUDqz56dP9J7QCI7As8y_Q-ruUfMOwqh2wkbY0FcF1PReBoq6E9c9-YMf7yTC7yg4LgFN7s2D1PeGfDzco9KqHllwyqNDwIane3iw"></figure>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 04:02</strong></p>
<p>A Broker, least in our world, is some who Buys and sells goods for someone else. They might be using Orange Ink for their paperwork. Sounds like they've been working with Janet</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:02</strong></p>
<p>"Congratulate Researcher March but provide her material for social as well as talking points for Hyles and Laidlaw.&nbsp; Consider Carrie's contribution on twitch but do not issue contract until Aetherial Studies is ready."</p>
<p><strong>GOddman — Today at 04:02</strong></p>
<p>oh now we see you typing</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 04:02</strong></p>
<p>So Carrie is a Twitch Streamer. Gives us a Lead</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Today at 04:02</strong></p>
<p>does Carry=Carrie?</p>
<p><strong>GOddman — Today at 04:03</strong></p>
<p>it's good tho</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:03</strong></p>
<p>Carry and Carrie could be the same thing.&nbsp; The quill isn't always the best at distinguishing.</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Today at 04:03</strong></p>
<p>also were all researchers in the main discord server from the 6th of Aug or have more joined at different times after that?</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 04:06</strong></p>
<p>anything else peach?</p>
<p><strong>GOddman — Today at 04:06</strong></p>
<p>no suspects, actually</p>
<p>also what is Carry's gender?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:07</strong></p>
<p>I'm still reading</p>
<p>Broker Carry he/him pronouns.</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 04:08</strong></p>
<p>male then</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:09</strong></p>
<p>Carrie is she</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 04:09</strong></p>
<p>So there's TWO Of them?</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 04:09</strong></p>
<p>oh boy</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Today at 04:09</strong></p>
<p>thats not confusing /s</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 04:09</strong></p>
<p>no not at all</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:10</strong></p>
<p>UMAD is a very confusing place.</p>
<p>Belthid, Belthidian, Belthas, Belthean</p>
<p>Language is confusing</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Today at 04:11</strong></p>
<p>do you know if all of these people are in the project grindstone discord server?</p>
<p>or were before you left</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:11</strong></p>
<p>I don't know...</p>
<p>New name again</p>
<p>Delfin</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 04:13</strong></p>
<p>Again</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:13</strong></p>
<p>thoughts?</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 04:13</strong></p>
<p>Not a clue</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 04:14</strong></p>
<p>Nope</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 04:14</strong></p>
<p>Always more questions than answers</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 04:14</strong></p>
<p>Are they He or She?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:14</strong></p>
<p>He by the looks of it.</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 04:15</strong></p>
<p>2 boys 1 girl</p>
<p>oh my</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 04:15</strong></p>

<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:15</strong></p>
<p>I've seen him at the Whimzy and at Lamented Liens!</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 04:15</strong></p>
<p>BINGO!</p>
<p>He's another VA</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 04:15</strong></p>
<p>boom baby</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 04:15</strong></p>
<p>rather new one</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:17</strong></p>
<p>I'm hope this has been at all helpful.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 04:17</strong></p>
<p>We've gotten a few leads, at least</p>
<p><strong>GOddman — Today at 04:17</strong></p>
<p>anything else?</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 04:17</strong></p>
<p>it was great</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 04:17</strong></p>
<p>Now we just need to figure out who these other new people are</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 04:17</strong></p>
<p>Damn shades! Good on ya!</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:19</strong></p>
<p>Looking through more…</p>
<p><strong>GOddman — Today at 04:20</strong></p>
<p>Pog</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:21</strong></p>
<p>"The experiment I'm sure has been productive but interdepartmental action ought be approved by associated departments.&nbsp; When will we be applying rules and regulations to the applicant pages?"</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 04:21</strong></p>
<p>Hello</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:21</strong></p>
<p>"Need to Know"</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 04:21</strong></p>
<p>They did recently add a channel by that name in the Discord, but it's still empty. Seems someone's getting impatient</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 04:21</strong></p>
<p>of course</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:21</strong></p>
<p>"To what level?"</p>
<p>"Twelve"</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 04:22</strong></p>
<p>Wow</p>

<p>no way</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 04:22</strong></p>
<p>thats high</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 04:22</strong></p>
<p>Wow! that high a clearance for Rules? Seems wierd</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 04:22</strong></p>
<p>Can you honestly blame them after witnessing the chaos?</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 04:22</strong></p>
<p>Wtf</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:23</strong></p>
<p>"A request for expenditure of healthy expiative by allowance"</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 04:23</strong></p>
<p>What</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 04:23</strong></p>
<p>Still level 12? Hmm what are they hiding</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:23</strong></p>
<p>"Denied"</p>
<p>"Screw you Janet"</p>
<p>"You will be billed"</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 04:24</strong></p>
<p>Hahahaha</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 04:24</strong></p>
<p>Lol</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 04:24</strong></p>
<p>thats funny</p>
<p><strong>GOddman — Today at 04:24</strong></p>
<p>who's asking with janet?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 04:25</strong></p>
<p>Damn, Janet's pissing people off now</p>
<p><strong>GOddman — Today at 04:25</strong></p>
<p>and what do they mean by being billed?</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 04:25</strong></p>
<p>So yelling at janet is a billable offense?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:25</strong></p>
<p>I don't get names just transcripts</p>
<p>Honestly the Rules and Regulations book is so long and changes so often it's practically worthless.</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 04:26</strong></p>
<p>who need rules</p>
<p><strong>GOddman — Today at 04:26</strong></p>
<p>we are already the Outlaws</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 04:27</strong></p>
<p>where we're going we don't need rules</p>
<p><strong>GOddman — Today at 04:27</strong></p>
<p>(for Umad at least)</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:28</strong></p>
<p>Lots of paper…</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 04:31</strong></p>
<p>anything else peach?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:32</strong></p>
<p>Looking</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 04:32</strong></p>
<p>Give them a Minute</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:32</strong></p>
<p>Banter</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 04:32</strong></p>
<p>K</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:32</strong></p>
<p>Wait</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 04:32</strong></p>
<p>???</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 04:32</strong></p>
<p>whats up?</p>
<p><strong>ZellaSwiffham — Today at 04:32</strong></p>
<p>these are different, Peach always uses caps</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:36</strong></p>
<p>It looks like some of the chaos and stalling is on purpose but they can't continue to do this as they have limited time.&nbsp; I think things are going to get busy soon.</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 04:37</strong></p>
<p>oh boy</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Today at 04:37</strong></p>
<p>how valuable is 15 departmental points of commendation?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:38</strong></p>
<p>That again…</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 04:38</strong></p>
<p>Something the matter?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:40</strong></p>
<p>It's something recommended by Culture a long time ago to improve performance and morale but it came as a means of evaluating people for potential advancement.&nbsp; What is did though is make some savage competition.</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Today at 05:19</strong></p>
<p>Does the name Jack64 or Jackie :p have any significance to you Peach?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 05:23</strong></p>
<p>It doesnt</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Today at 05:25</strong></p>
<p>also do you know anything about the cheese cult that seems to be forming in the main server as, UMAD management have said that its a product of quiet observation and is necessary for the admissions process?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 05:25</strong></p>
<p>The...what?</p>
<p><strong>ZellaSwiffham — Today at 05:25</strong></p>
<p>oh right</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Today at 05:25</strong></p>
<p>theres a cult growing withing the server based around cheese</p>
<p><strong>ZellaSwiffham — Today at 05:26</strong></p>
<p>about a dozen of the (mostly new) applicants have created a sect based on cheese</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Today at 05:26</strong></p>
<p>their existance has been noted by UMAD as allowed as long as it doesnt affect performance</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 05:26</strong></p>
<p>……</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 05:27</strong></p>
<p>I'm familiar withthis test too.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 05:28</strong></p>
<p>A test? I would’ve guessed they were only allowing it to keep people entertained while they work behind the scenes</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 05:28</strong></p>
<p>I'm willing to bet everything is a test to them</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 05:28</strong></p>
<p>This is part of it.&nbsp; They also aren't posting rules on purpose.&nbsp; They will come in maybe an interval or two however.</p>
<p><strong>ZellaSwiffham — Today at 05:29</strong></p>
<p>the cheese sect is the test?</p>
<p>or UMAD trying to get chuck to rat you out</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Today at 05:29</strong></p>
<p>would it be considered a good or bad thing to join and follow the cult of cheese and would it be likely that theres an insider from UMAD within the cult to promote the cult to see who joins?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 05:29</strong></p>
<p>Observation without regulation</p>
<p><strong>ZellaSwiffham — Today at 05:30</strong></p>
<p>right, they want to see how people react when they dont have anything else to do?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 05:30</strong></p>
<p>They are learning about the character of the applicants.</p>
<p><strong>ZellaSwiffham — Today at 05:30</strong></p>
<p>Interesting</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 05:30</strong></p>
<p>Seeing how they act in Chaos, so they know how to regulate them. Makes sense</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 05:30</strong></p>
<p>Ah of course</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Today at 05:30</strong></p>
<p>so&nbsp; joining a cult would be bad, i assume</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 05:30</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, best we stay out of that mess</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 05:30</strong></p>
<p>from chaos cames order</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 05:31</strong></p>
<p>Its certainly crazy. But with the amount of new applicants overnight im not surprised it went off the rails.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 05:32</strong></p>
<p>Indeed. I suspect those of us that don’t give in to the cheese might be viewed more highly. We’ll see</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 05:32</strong></p>
<p>I mean, let's be honest, we're a bit chaotic, but in a small group like this, it's easier to stay in control. When it gets that big, you need to have set rules, or all hell breaks loose</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 05:33</strong></p>
<p>For sure. I'll be curious to watch the fallout. And if the 'cheese cult' gets dinged on their scorecard</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Today at 06:06</strong></p>
<p>i could have influence over the cheese cult atm</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 07:20</strong></p>
<p>@Peach ! Pauchik is in grindstone server!</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 07:22</strong></p>
<p>I can't really see it though</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 07:22</strong></p>
<p>He seems to be the first researcher in the server</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 07:22</strong></p>
<p>I know, but its worth mentioning that other staff is joining</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 07:22</strong></p>
<p>From what he says</p>
<p>Also, he was the one who bridged communication</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 08:09</strong></p>
<p>So Pauchik said there's humanoid constructs for security purposes? Do you know what these look like?</p>
<p><strong>ZellaSwiffham — Today at 08:11</strong></p>
<p>we have confirmed the existence of scalies in Dial</p>

<p><strong>ZellaSwiffham — Today at 13:10</strong></p>
<p>oof</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Today at 13:13</strong></p>
<p>to be fair that whole conversation is very confused in general</p>
<p>they start out thinking that there is a UMAD plant within the participants in this call</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:184px;"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/8V7T1vcNk6J3U9SO09Qtq6ypk0jebeaGI84pJJ0WmaUdjiakNYkARH5WJ9f4Mlwc_YcK1ZNu64qRQt7whbmDduXBHJEfcBlk1TGLq08CMFchWh1KXBuWcvEt0ALd9Lm7s5JGwTpc"></figure>
<p>then someone links it to the 'undesirable', which wouldn't make sense, because why would UMAD rat out their own plant / call attention to them?</p>
<p>so i feel like tyler or shades are more suspected as umad plants than anything else right now</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 17:14</strong></p>
<p>I think it's either Jackie or Boy to be honest.</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Today at 17:15</strong></p>
<p>idk who was saying it before but i'm a bit swayed that dowan might be it</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 17:15</strong></p>
<p>You mean the UMAD plant?</p>
<p>Would the UMAD plant be a researcher posing as an applicant?</p>
<p>If there is one.</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Today at 17:15</strong></p>
<p>posing as an applicant, i assume</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 17:16</strong></p>
<p>Though I still have my suspicions on Autumn. Yeah, when we were listening to one sing we all muted and listened then cheered.... then suddenly there was a cultural chat channel.</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 17:16</strong></p>
<p>Although, is there even any evidence for a UMAD plant?</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 17:16</strong></p>
<p>designed for music</p>
<p>I'm going to voice</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 17:16</strong></p>
<p>It could be Autumn, or anyone else in the call at that exact time.</p>
<p>Okay, do we join?</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 17:17</strong></p>
<p>I meant here if anyone wants quick explaining.</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 17:17</strong></p>
<p>What gives us reason to believe there's an mole?</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 17:17</strong></p>
<p>I'll go into the PG chat later</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 17:17</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, seems like the mole idea was from a misunderstanding.</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 17:17</strong></p>
<p>^</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 17:18</strong></p>
<p>Although I don't know unless I know the details of that call, I was asleep at the time.</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 17:18</strong></p>
<p>It literally all started from the fact that I didn't get moved into the new channel</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 17:18</strong></p>
<p>What new channel? Whaddya mean by moved?</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 17:19</strong></p>
<p>Like I was saying. There was a person in voice chat that kept singing and we kept praising. then when we all muted our mics to listen to them sing. When they were done we all cheered and praised them heavily. Then not even two minutes after that happened a music designated chat what made. UMAD nor any of the admins were on at the time and it was getting changed real time for me and Shades</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 17:19</strong></p>
<p>A new voice channel was made and everyone was moved into it except me</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 17:19</strong></p>
<p>I manually moved to it</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 17:19</strong></p>
<p>Ah.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 17:19</strong></p>
<p>I saw the new voice channel and jumped in myself</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 17:19</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, that's pretty odd.</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 17:19</strong></p>
<p>Ah, so did everyone do that?</p>
<p>Or did only the people in this discord not get moved?</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 17:20</strong></p>
<p>Probably. No one said they were moved, just commented on the new chat and jumped to there being a mole</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 17:20</strong></p>
<p>To send us a message?</p>
<p>Oh</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 17:21</strong></p>
<p>With how things happened though, even I believe one of them is a mole</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 17:21</strong></p>
<p>Okay, that in my eyes does seem indicative that UMAD, or someone with admin, acquired information in real time that someone was singing in the chat, and the singer was uncomfortable with the praise.</p>
<p>Then the question of how they acquired information is in question, with there being a mole being one, if not the only, explanation.</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 17:22</strong></p>
<p>Oh, it makes sense now, but surely it could've been pure coincidence that a new voice channel was made?</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 17:22</strong></p>
<p>That is also a good point, how do we know the channel was specifically for singing?</p>
<p>Well, then again, maybe UMAD anticipated that most of the influx of people would be from singer YouTubers.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 17:22</strong></p>
<p>A wise man once said: There’s no such thing as a coincidence</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 17:23</strong></p>
<p>And therefore deduced that people liked to sing.</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 17:23</strong></p>
<p>Look at the channels name</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 17:23</strong></p>
<p>I don't know how to ;-;</p>

<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 17:24</strong></p>
<p>Ah, thanks.</p>
<p>So from the timing, I conclude that it, to me at least, is rather unlikely that the creation of a music forum and the singer's debut are independent events.</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 17:26</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, starting to see that now</p>
<p>Was dowan there in the call?</p>
<p>@Snow_Woman</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Today at 17:26</strong></p>
<p>Yeah</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 17:27</strong></p>
<p>Might be worth keeping an eye on dowan, especially since he seems to know as much as us</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Today at 17:27</strong></p>
<p>this is everyone who was in the call</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:164px;"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/3y0k1pyiEpVIryBVNQgaSbj9drvet3x5-FU-2jrPJKRbwkqZxRgM3cn2wolB5iXLdjH_G3pi2dccZk3eiuqroeYIZrXgqLPRZz77zqnDLHf0HISOO5DOVS2A2B5Z5bSNCPYsRkLN"></figure>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 17:27</strong></p>
<p>Hopefully Dowan and I are bonding over our mutual love of science fiction.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 17:28</strong></p>
<p>Yeah he's on my list of suspects as well</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Today at 17:28</strong></p>
<p>these are all the possibility, its possible the cheese people are involved but i doubt it</p>

<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 17:29</strong></p>
<p>Between boy, jackie, autumn, and dowan for me.</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 17:29</strong></p>
<p>We can guess anyone that turned on facecan yesterday is clean</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Today at 17:29</strong></p>
<p>i did tell you all that Dowan and Jack64 were one's to watch</p>
<p>facecam was only Boy, right?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 17:29</strong></p>
<p>No, there were several</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 17:29</strong></p>
<p>naw I was facecamming too</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 17:30</strong></p>
<p>How would we conclude this statement?</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Today at 17:30</strong></p>
<p>i went to bed so i didnt see them all</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 17:30</strong></p>
<p>Boy, Dowan, Cheesepope, i think all of them were on cam</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 17:30</strong></p>
<p>Dowan wasn't on cam</p>
<p>Think he left when we switched to facecam</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 17:30</strong></p>
<p>Oh, Could have sworn I saw them.</p>
<p>Then again it was late for me</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 17:31</strong></p>
<p>Alec also had facecam on</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Today at 17:32</strong></p>
<p>so Boy, Cheesepope and Alec but not Dowan.</p>
<p>also we should probably move to pitschat rather than flood this channel bcs of the transcript</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:44</strong></p>
<p>How is everyone</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Today at 18:45</strong></p>
<p>i am alright, how are you?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 18:45</strong></p>
<p>Doing alright. Just watching the Chaos unfold in the main chat</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:46</strong></p>
<p>Tired but I'm fine.&nbsp; Chaos?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 18:46</strong></p>
<p>They haven't added the Rules yet, so a lot of the others in the server have just been acting really goofy</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Today at 18:47</strong></p>
<p>at the moment the people seem to think there is something hidden in the poem on the FaQ page of the website</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 18:47</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, they tried looking at the first letters of each lines and running them through decryption tools.</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Today at 18:47</strong></p>
<p>and also anagrams</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:47</strong></p>

<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:50</strong></p>
<p>It's talking about Alchemist Dust.&nbsp; A very popular alchemical reagent that creates euphoria, loss of some sensation, and heightened activity when ingested recreationally.</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Today at 18:50</strong></p>
<p>so its a recreational drug?</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 18:50</strong></p>
<p>So like cocaine on our plane.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 18:50</strong></p>
<p>Sounds like Cannibus, a Plant-based drug in our world</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 18:51</strong></p>
<p>Yeah Cannibis is a better analogy, I was focused on it being a powder.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:52</strong></p>
<p>Looking into both of these.</p>
<p><strong>ZellaSwiffham — Today at 18:53</strong></p>
<p>is alchemist dust legal in Dial?</p>
<p>a lot of drugs, recreational or otherwise, are veeeery illegal here</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 18:54</strong></p>
<p>Well, depends on where you are.</p>
<p><strong>ZellaSwiffham — Today at 18:54</strong></p>
<p>yeah thats true, but in the general sense</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 18:54</strong></p>
<p>Mainly due to be being very addictive and some rather dangerous to our bodies. Cannibus is more debatable, with it becoming more accepted these days</p>

<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 19:00</strong></p>
<p>Careful. From what we know, if you get him going, he might be hard to stop talking about his "Hobby"</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Today at 19:02</strong></p>
<p>necromancy is interesting, and if hes talking a lot that could be interpreted as a friendship that could allow me to get into the necromancy department easier</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 19:03</strong></p>
<p>Only 3rd grade and above is illegal.&nbsp; But you can carry 3rd if you have a permit.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 19:03</strong></p>
<p>Not that much different from here. Cannibus has reach a similar point of getting a permit in some areas.</p>

<p>Peach, do you know what "Tower" Pauchik is refering to in these messages?</p>

<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:39</strong></p>
<p>I'm back.&nbsp; they called for a multi-departmental meeting.&nbsp; I started scrambling and was out the door about 40 ticks ago</p>
<p>Maybe they are branching out</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Today at 20:41</strong></p>
<p>branching out?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:41</strong></p>
<p>Creating a new campus</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 20:41</strong></p>
<p>Is it also in Dial?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:41</strong></p>
<p>But I don't think that's the case</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 20:41</strong></p>
<p>Ah.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:41</strong></p>
<p>Dial is one campus</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:42</strong></p>
<p>I suspect it's a construct to allow better connection to our world</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:42</strong></p>
<p>a Universal Magical Academy at X</p>
<p>I don't know many cities in your world</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:43</strong></p>
<p>A lot. We're a pretty Populated world</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 20:43</strong></p>
<p>On the order of ~10,000.</p>
<p>We have a population of ~7.8 billion.</p>
<p>Well, could be ~100,000 too, depends on how you define cities.</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Today at 20:45</strong></p>
<p>Could the new Campus be the tower Pauchik was talking about?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:47</strong></p>
<p>That's what I'm suggesting</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Today at 20:48</strong></p>
<p>And it's somewhere in our world, right?</p>
<p>So you know what country it will be in?</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 20:49</strong></p>
<p>And will this tower be located close to where our planes are bridged?</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Today at 20:49</strong></p>
<p>The most likely country is The United States</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 20:49</strong></p>
<p>Like planar overlap?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:51</strong></p>
<p>This is speculation.&nbsp; We don't know what they are up to yet</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 20:51</strong></p>
<p>Fair.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:52</strong></p>
<p>I'm thinking if I should make a mole account for the chat or if it's too dangerous</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 20:53</strong></p>
<p>Hm... do we have any idea on how they might find out the mole account is the "undesirable"?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:54</strong></p>
<p>They make it their mission to be in the know on things.&nbsp; Whatever technology or spell they need is probably only a matter of time before they find it or how</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 20:58</strong></p>
<p>For the mole account, do you intend to use it solely for observation, or also interaction?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:58</strong></p>
<p>Interaction seems risky</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 20:58</strong></p>
<p>That it does.</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Today at 20:58</strong></p>
<p>Simple interactions such as saying hello when you join I imagine is harmless</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:58</strong></p>
<p>I actually disagree. If you do it right, talking with everyone might make you stick out less.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 20:59</strong></p>
<p>We're running an undercover spy operation. Everything we do is risky</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 20:59</strong></p>
<p>Anyone familiar with the limits it's possible to program a fake account to run a script ad infinitum, without it being an actual bot?</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 21:00</strong></p>
<p>The question to be considered is if the potential gains outweigh the risks</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 21:00</strong></p>
<p>I'm sorta worried that UMAD might pick up the regular transfer of data from Peach's device to the UMAD server if they interact too much.</p>
<p>But I don't know how that would be implemented, however.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 21:00</strong></p>
<p>Just talking with us brings that same risk. So not much riskier to be part of the main chat.</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 21:01</strong></p>
<p>Ah, true. It's being transported to the same Discord physical server anyways I suppose, that'd be a lot of data to track, especially considering UMAD's own interaction with this plane.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 21:02</strong></p>
<p>Yeah. It's more a matter of saying anything that stands out. If they blend in with the other applicants, no one will even bat an eye</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Today at 21:03</strong></p>
<p>That statement I agree with, they wouldn't suspect an applicant that seems normal.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 21:04</strong></p>
<p>Perhaps attempt to solve the puzzles, but not solve them on their own, so it seems like they don't know anything. Then it's just playing along with the others, even cracking a joke or two if they can</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 21:04</strong></p>
<p>I can do my best I suppose</p>
<p>I'll think on it a bit more.&nbsp; If I make an account I'll let you know</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 21:05</strong></p>
<p>If you do, I suggest we do not add it here. Harder to trace it back to us if we don't</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 21:06</strong></p>
<p>Probably a good idea</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 21:08</strong></p>
<p>I agree</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 21:21</strong></p>
<p>I'd say you'll have to be really careful if you do make a new account and come back onto the server. UMAD proposed to me the job of trying to track down the undesirable, which I declined but it gives me reason to believe they'll ask more people to do it.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 21:25</strong></p>
<p>I'm certain they will.</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 21:29</strong></p>
<p>Wouldnt you taking that job be good though? Gives us an in to throw them off the trail</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Today at 21:30</strong></p>
<p>that would mean chuck wouldnt make any progress with umad though, since taking this job would necessitate doing it poorly</p>
<p>also they've already declined it, i think it might be a bit suspicious to suddenly take it now</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 21:31</strong></p>
<p>Or sending them on a wild goosechase. Though that wouldn't be ideal at this point</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 21:34</strong></p>
<p>I said I was interested in the moderator job, plus if I end up feeding them false information that can put a target on my back if they're smart enough. Being a moderator however gives me higher clearance and puts me in an immediate position of trust with UMAD.</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Today at 21:34</strong></p>
<p>yeah, thats a good play</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 21:35</strong></p>
<p>Fair</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 21:36</strong></p>
<p>It's a good Compromise</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 21:37</strong></p>
<p>at the end of the day I'd rather keep up the "oh I'm just a really enthusiastic applicant" schtick rather than be a completely active saboteur, it'll help us in the long run</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 21:37</strong></p>
<p>Playing close to the chest. I dig it. We'll think about striking back when we're ready.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 21:40</strong></p>
<p>I have complete faith in you Chuck</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 21:41</strong></p>
<p>Thanks, I appreciate it</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Yesterday at 23:34</strong></p>
<p>Does the name GillieMason mean anything to you Peach?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 23:34</strong></p>
<p>yes</p>
<p>Works alchemy</p>
<p>Very... forward person</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Yesterday at 23:34</strong></p>
<p>shes just joined the main server</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Yesterday at 23:34</strong></p>
<p>They joined seconds ago</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Yesterday at 23:34</strong></p>
<p>I can tell, she's blunt so far.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 23:34</strong></p>
<p>She has a bit of a temper.</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Yesterday at 23:34</strong></p>
<p>so Hanford didnt join as we expected</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Yesterday at 23:35</strong></p>
<p>Oh dear.</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Yesterday at 23:35</strong></p>
<p>she's very forward</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 23:35</strong></p>
<p>I do have some advice, she really enjoys botony</p>
<p>the boring, boring study of botony</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Yesterday at 23:36</strong></p>
<p>She's a plant nerd</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Yesterday at 23:36</strong></p>
<p>'Convince you to be here and not other departments'&nbsp; forward indeed</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Yesterday at 23:36</strong></p>
<p>holy shit</p>
<p>Plants</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Yesterday at 23:36</strong></p>
<p>I like the cut of her jib!</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Yesterday at 23:36</strong></p>
<p>i love plant stuff</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 23:36</strong></p>
<p>To each their own</p>
<p>I find the study a little tedious myself.</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Yesterday at 23:37</strong></p>
<p>you are named after a fruit, i dont think you can complain</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 23:37</strong></p>
<p>I suppose that's fair</p>
<p>it's just an alias</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Yesterday at 23:37</strong></p>
<p>Hey now, no need to be rude</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Yesterday at 23:37</strong></p>
<p>i was only joking around</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 23:38</strong></p>
<p>I know, sorry I've been such an ass lately.</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Yesterday at 23:38</strong></p>
<p>it's all good, it's a very tense period</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Yesterday at 23:38</strong></p>
<p>i disagree, youve been very helpful and friendly especially given how difficult it sounds like its been for you</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Yesterday at 23:39</strong></p>
<p>No need to apologize. Undoubtably things have been quite stressful on your end. The gears are in motion and they keep grinding</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Yesterday at 23:39</strong></p>
<p>We're all on the same team. I took emry's comment in more harsh a tone than it was meant. Thats on me.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 23:39</strong></p>
<p>There has just been a lot of signs of danger lately.&nbsp; I sometimes wonder if maybe I overstepped or if maybe I'm just wrong</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Yesterday at 23:39</strong></p>
<p>I feel that</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Yesterday at 23:40</strong></p>
<p>what do you mean by overstepped?</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Yesterday at 23:40</strong></p>
<p>Unfortunately, sometimes all you can do is just move forward</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Yesterday at 23:40</strong></p>
<p>There are risks but I dont think youre wrong</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 23:41</strong></p>
<p>Just acted foolishly.&nbsp; I sometimes doubt what I'm doing is right.&nbsp; This institution exists because of the direction of Rameus and we do a lot of good…</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Yesterday at 23:41</strong></p>
<p>I mean, we already know UMAD is targeting one of us, foreign nationals, for a biological experiment. I'd say that's cause enough to have some doubt towards them.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Yesterday at 23:42</strong></p>
<p>It's ok Peach, I don't think you need me to explain that things have been stressful</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Yesterday at 23:42</strong></p>
<p>If out world is anything to go off of, an institution with the backing of the government may do a lot of good, but that doesnt mean theyre innocent. People often do terrible things in the pursuit of the greater good</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Yesterday at 23:42</strong></p>
<p>The main idea is of good intention, but there may be bad apples that could corrupt that ideal. They need to be investigated, and if there is a danger, it needs to be stopped</p>
<p>"The Road to Hell is Paved with Good Intentions"</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 23:43</strong></p>
<p>I read recently that the funding for Grindstone was signed off on by the Assistant Headmaster.&nbsp; I have a lot of respect for him and Headmaster.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Yesterday at 23:44</strong></p>
<p>Respect doesn't mean blind faith. One should always question things like this. We're here cause we seek the truth. If all's good, we back off, but if there's any chance they're up to something bad, we'll make sure it doesn't happen.</p>
<p>You suspected something was Amiss. Do not question your instincts. Often, your gut is pointing you in the right direction</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 23:46</strong></p>
<p>If we were wrong though and we back off I'll likely be in danger for the foreseeable future</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Yesterday at 23:46</strong></p>
<p>That is why we keep investigating till we know for sure. We know the risks, but we're not backing down. We're in this till the end. Hell, I have to be</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Yesterday at 23:46</strong></p>
<p>i have an in with Pauchik and he seems to have some questionable morals</p>
<p>so&nbsp; maybe thatll lead somewhere</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 23:48</strong></p>
<p>Questionable morals?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Yesterday at 23:48</strong></p>
<p>Their Hobby doesn't seem to be a very safe idea</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Yesterday at 23:49</strong></p>
<p>We all knew we would be taking risks when we signed on. We still made that decision and we'll stick by it. If UMAD is up to something fishy, we'll find out</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 23:49</strong></p>
<p>It's harmless...just creepy</p>
<p><strong>UnknownEmrys — Yesterday at 23:49</strong></p>
<p>from my understanding he drew a thin line between life and death</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 23:49</strong></p>
<p>How so?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Yesterday at 23:50</strong></p>
<p>He's playing God. In our world, that has NEVER ended well for us</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Yesterday at 23:50</strong></p>
<p>He's in Necromancy. That's as thin it gets between life and death</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 23:51</strong></p>
<p>I don't understand the meaning of playing god?</p>
<p>We all emulate gods.&nbsp; That is the spread of domains</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Yesterday at 23:51</strong></p>
<p>Well, in our world we have set lines on how we conduct ourselves.</p>
<p>Playing god I suppose would be overstepping those lines.</p>
<p>Like, ethics committees say that we can't clone humans, or grow them in, say, a glass tube. Playing god would be doing just that.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Yesterday at 23:52</strong></p>
<p>It may seem normal in your world, but we have a saying ours: "Power Corrupts, and Absolute Power Corrupts Absolutely"</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 23:53</strong></p>
<p>I still don't understand what you mean by playing god</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Yesterday at 23:54</strong></p>
<p>all power must be held accountable, peach</p>
<p>no amount of good can justify evil, and we're here to find out where UMAD's actions lie</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Yesterday at 23:55</strong></p>
<p>On a different note, does the name "Shakespeare" mean anything in your world Peach?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 23:55</strong></p>
<p>I'm not sure what you mean by evil…</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Yesterday at 23:56</strong></p>
<p>I ask because someone was drawing comparisons between King Orthelo and a similarly named character from a work of literature in our world</p>
<p><strong>ThisIsAName0 — Yesterday at 23:57</strong></p>
<p>Well, since we don't have gods, we sorta define "good" and "evil" in the context of humans themselves. There are many ways to define good/evil and moral/immoral actions, for example the Utilitarian school of thought that says something along the lines of good is maximizing net societal pleasure, and evil is minimizing net societal pleasure.</p>
<p>Then there's a man named Kant who said that people have lines to not cross, and in all your actions, you must not cross those lines.</p>
<p>...at least I think he said that. I dunno.</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Yesterday at 23:58</strong></p>
<p>in a lot more words, yes</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 23:59</strong></p>
<p>Hmm....&nbsp; I don't often think of the good and the moral being so close.</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Yesterday at 23:59</strong></p>
<p>ah, we sometimes utilize good to mean moral</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 23:59</strong></p>
<p>The moral is based in perspective and is social while the good is rational.</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Yesterday at 23:59</strong></p>
<p>in what way is the good rational?</p>
