<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:12</strong></p>
<p>Alright, the trap has been placed to intercept correspondence by air elemental.&nbsp; Hopefully I grab something within a day.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 00:40</strong></p>
<p>Nice, thanks so much.</p>
<p>Quick thing, you mentioned that you were surprised to find that March is on our end, what made you believe otherwise before?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:04</strong></p>
<p>There is a lot that goes on at UMAD.&nbsp; I've seen her name and knew she was a researcher.&nbsp; What I didn't know is that there were researchers of ours on your plane. There is no clear indication as to who is and is not from where you are on my end.&nbsp; I have determined that each of the employee records for them are missing from files I can access at my clearance level however.</p>
<p>I hope you don't mind but I've been going through the old logs on the general chat.&nbsp; Researcher Hyles referred you Chuck but who referred you TheShades?</p>
<p>Also, if there is any insight I can give on the admissions process I'd be happy to provide it to hedge our chances on getting you into a UMAD department.&nbsp; Speaking of, have either of you considered what departments you'd join?&nbsp; Spreading ourselves out into the various departments might be the most efficient way to gather information.&nbsp; I can provide what I know about each department.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:09</strong></p>
<p>Hyles is the one who referred me as well. In fact, I know Researcher Hyles quite well, since he moonlights as a Singer. He just performed this weekend, as a matter of fact, and I have a recording of said performance.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 02:10</strong></p>
<p>Good idea, best to get an edge on the process so we can make sure we get in. I'm assuming we can only join research departments?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:10</strong></p>
<p>I think Hyles works closely with March.&nbsp; I know they are frequently working together.</p>
<p>You're currently in a researcher applicant pool so unfortunately that is the case.</p>
<p>Who recruited you Butcher?</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 02:13</strong></p>
<p>Ah damn, I would've gone into Administration if I could so that we could get eyes inside where key documents might be going, or maybe Human Resources so we can find out any unethical practices in UMAD</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 02:15</strong></p>
<p>Oh hey peach is back</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:15</strong></p>
<p>They asked you a question, actually</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 02:15</strong></p>
<p>Did they? One sec. Let me get caught up</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:17</strong></p>
<p>As I understand it you were all added to an applicant pool for the field research track.&nbsp; The first mission is for the establishment of applicants.&nbsp; Usually the easiest tests to make certain there is a commitment to the applicant process.&nbsp; The second mission is the aptitude examination which when I did it was a list of questions for you it looks like it'll be a series of smaller tests.&nbsp; The third mission is an examination of physical aptitude.&nbsp; The final is typically an interview.&nbsp; The way you've been tested is unconventional but that does makes sense since you are extra planar entities not too dissimilar from deific extensions, devils, and the like.&nbsp; They must have had to adapt for your situation.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 02:17</strong></p>
<p>If March works frequently with Hyles and she's on this end, she might go by Annapantsu online? She's sung a fair few times with Hyles and she's on this server</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:18</strong></p>
<p>Researcher March's given name is Anna so that would make sense.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:19</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, that's her. I just confirmed through her profile in other locations. Makes me wonder if we know the third one, Marino, now.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:19</strong></p>
<p>I don't think she is singing for UMAD…</p>
<p>I'd think you knew Freeman.&nbsp; She is associated with something called Anime?&nbsp; The word comes up on your discord profile as well.&nbsp; Maybe you two know each other somehow?&nbsp; I haven't looked into "anime" on the google yet.</p>
<p>I just used the google.&nbsp; There is so much anime…</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 02:23</strong></p>
<p>March is who I saw, but she was just responding to Hyle's tweet, so in a roundabout way I guess Hyle?</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 02:24</strong></p>
<p>Anime is a beast of its own on Google, search it at your own risk Peach</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:24</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, anime is kind of my thing too. I'm an Anime Reviewer myself. Wait, is Freeman a Female, by chance?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:24</strong></p>
<p>Yes, she is.</p>
<p>All Humans too.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:26</strong></p>
<p>I think I might know her then. If my hunch is right, her first name is Lizzie or Elizabeth?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:26</strong></p>
<p>Yes, I believe so.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:27</strong></p>
<p>I knew it! She's what's known as a Voice Actor, as she plays some characters in Anime. I've Reviewed a couple of her performances.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:27</strong></p>
<p>I don't know Marino's given name however.</p>
<p>Maybe Culture has something to do with this…</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 02:28</strong></p>
<p>Oh wow Lizzie is involved too? Awesome!</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:28</strong></p>
<p>You seem very familiar with Lizzie, Peach?</p>
<p>Butcher rather.&nbsp; You can tell I'm tired.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:29</strong></p>
<p>She is also a Youtube singer. She covered the OP of one of the Anime she did voice work for: In/Spectre, which I reviewed, and featured her cover on (Though I didn't realize it was her till after I made my video on it)</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:30</strong></p>
<p>I'll have to investigate</p>
<p>I should probably stay away from the employee files for awhile however.&nbsp; I've been there too much recently.</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 02:31</strong></p>
<p>Probably not as well as Shades since he's a reviewer but I've watched some of the anime shes been in</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:33</strong></p>
<p>She's also been in a series called "Jojo's Bizzare Adventures" which is where most have likely heard her voice before. I'd be cautious, though. That anime lives up to that name. It can be wierd, at least by our standards.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 02:34</strong></p>
<p>It took me a while to figure out who she was until I saw that she was in Jojo</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:34</strong></p>
<p>Did she belong to a Company at some point?&nbsp; It's not necessary for travel here anymore but not many people go on "adventures" these days without some protection or wealth.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:36</strong></p>
<p>It's just the name of a story. Freeman simply plays a Character in an anime fiction.</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 02:36</strong></p>
<p>A Company? Im not sure what business shed be contracted to, if any. I know nothing of the VA world.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 02:36</strong></p>
<p>I mean she likely has an agent that finds her acting jobs but in regards to Jojo's she acts out a fictional character's voice which is played over an animation</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 02:37</strong></p>
<p>She's an actor. Or rather, she uses her voice for animated characters.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:37</strong></p>
<p>Not a business company.&nbsp; I understand the misunderstanding.&nbsp; What I mean is a company by claim of local lordship.&nbsp; People who have a free travel visa.</p>
<p>I'm not going to understand this maybe we should move on to questions about departments.&nbsp; I'll research anime in my free time to get a clearer picture of things.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:39</strong></p>
<p>Fair enough, I could go all day on that topic, much like someone else you know. What Departments would we be likely sent to if we're brought on? We need to know what our options are?</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 02:40</strong></p>
<p>Sure. Tell us about the different departments. We know necromancy, and culture exist. And I think you mentioned a planar one too?</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 02:42</strong></p>
<p>If I remember correctly wasn't it Culture, Necromancy, Aetherial Study, Planar, Engineering, Alchemy, Infernal Affairs, Accounting, Administration, and Human Resources that you mentioned?</p>
<p>With the last four being no-goes because they're not research departments</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:43</strong></p>
<p>Necromancy is more appropriately titled a programming department.&nbsp; They work on aetherial structures, constructs we call them.&nbsp; Constructs have aetherial shape that overlays on the material object.&nbsp; It's much easier to craft a construct from a corpse however than hunks of metal.&nbsp; They specialize in the multidimensional code and networks that create the structure of these objects.&nbsp; Their department head does not communicate directly often but is very informative if you reach out to them.&nbsp; They seem to just be shut in their office all day.</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 02:44</strong></p>
<p>So if we reach out to Pauchik he'd be a good source of info. If we can reach out to him that is. Just gotta be okay with the nightmare fuel lol</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:45</strong></p>
<p>Culture is a strange department.&nbsp; They study everything from Richwood theory to history to social enigmas.&nbsp; They hope to better understand the foundations of culture and what makes a person themselves.&nbsp; Many of them are taught deceptive tactics so that they can produce "cleaner" data from their experiments.&nbsp; When the project is declared necessary for national security they usually do not even tell their subjects of their role.&nbsp; This makes them suspicious to me in just about everything they do.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 02:46</strong></p>
<p>Not a bad idea, at least one of us should probably head there then. I can only imagine the office politics though with everyone shut in with corpses to keep themselves busy</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 02:46</strong></p>

<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:47</strong></p>
<p>Ok, I was eyeing Culture, but sounds like it's not as simple as I thought. I'm not exactly the best of decievers. I'm too honest for my own good.</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 02:48</strong></p>
<p>Oh cultural just screams umbrella corp. Bet you any applicants that go there are just guinea pigs themselves</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 02:48</strong></p>
<p>I'm bad at lying but I can keep my mouth shut quite well when needed. Only problem is that since we're extraplanar we're bound to turn a lot of heads once someone's there.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:48</strong></p>
<p>Seems like what we consider a Spy Agency, in my opinion</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:49</strong></p>
<p>Engineering and Alchemy were once the same department and the Religious studies department was consumed by culture for the sake of secularity in study.&nbsp; Engineering lacks a department head and no one seems like they are in a rush to fill the position.&nbsp; Engineering operates on much of what you suspect and they are often involved in government projects especially military projects.&nbsp; They have a strange man there named Meer Soot who is very temperamental.&nbsp; It's believed his actions have led to the death of his last two assistants yet he still operates with a wealth of funding for his projects.&nbsp; Projects of nonsense that fit closer into aetherial research than anything.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 02:50</strong></p>
<p>If we happen to get a few more people here that we can trust we could probably assign at least one person for each department, ideally</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 02:51</strong></p>
<p>I think thats a good bare minimum, chuck.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:51</strong></p>
<p>It would be ideal to assign someone to each department.&nbsp; That would give us the largest spread of information.&nbsp; Speaking of extra planar...&nbsp; As I said before the Planar department does not keep their department head for long.&nbsp; They deal with some of the most dangerous field work as every plane you cross to provides a chance at being plane touched.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 02:52</strong></p>
<p>Plane touched? As in you get warped by that plane?</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 02:53</strong></p>
<p>So engineering sounds like Meer Soot calls the shots unofficially and is the mad scientist type?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:54</strong></p>
<p>Alchemy has a very informative and prompt head.&nbsp; He is a stickler for deadlines however and plays favorites often with his research funding practices.&nbsp; Not much to really say about them other than hold your breath when you can on that floor and if it looks volatile then it probably is.&nbsp; If it doesn't then it still probably is.</p>
<p>Meer Soot doesn't call any shots but I would definitely call the man mad.&nbsp; Plane Touched individuals are those whose perception has permanently warped due to the sudden need to acclimate to the new Belthidian Laws of the region in five dimensional space. You could simply lose your concept of time or you could lose consciousness entirely.&nbsp; It's still a mystery how it affects the sentient.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 02:56</strong></p>
<p>I was thinking of maybe trying Alchemy, in this plane I am actually studying for a degree in Chemistry so I might have a small head start in it</p>
<p>Assuming your plane has physical rules even slightly similar to ours</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 02:58</strong></p>
<p>Belthidian Laws? Im assuming thats something scientific like what we call physics?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 03:03</strong></p>
<p>Physics?&nbsp; That sounds a little closed in concept and takes the divine out of consideration.&nbsp; How can such a narrow sighted approach be practical.&nbsp; Much like chemistry, that takes out the spiritual concepts and simplifies the world to current attracting cubes and dodecahedrons together.&nbsp; Now the wheel is a much more reasonable explanation for the interactions of different material.&nbsp; I suppose I have to accept that your world must have some different Toristic concepts that are practical...&nbsp; Afterall, I've never seen the technology in these anime you show me.&nbsp; That is fiction however so maybe I'm getting ahead of myself.</p>
<p>Maybe I'm being too critical, my apologies.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 03:05</strong></p>
<p>No worries. We're an admittedly more Primative species here. We don't have access to stuff like Divination or Planar like you've described. Most of our technology is all pretty basic by comparison</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 03:05</strong></p>
<p>No need to apologise, it seems we all have a lot we can learn from each other</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 03:06</strong></p>
<p>Pretty much. It might explain why UMAD is looking at our world right now</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 03:07</strong></p>
<p>Very different worlds with very different rules it seems</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 03:10</strong></p>
<p>Oh!&nbsp; Aetherial study.&nbsp; They study aetherial effects from all stages.&nbsp; They make the magic happen, pun intended.&nbsp; They research Summation, Aeonization, and magical programming.&nbsp; If you want to learn aetherial theory they are the guys.&nbsp; Though many times you leave work glowing just a little bit.</p>
<p>What you suggest Shades make me think of the planar department's involvement.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 03:11</strong></p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>Well, I think Aetherial Study might be more up my alley.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 03:12</strong></p>
<p>Six departments so it looks like you're three short if we want to spread across all departments.</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 03:12</strong></p>
<p>I mean the planar dept being the ones to find this plane would make sense given their focus?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 03:13</strong></p>
<p>We're already looking at someone else to join us, but we had a few other names we're considering, so we'll see who we can bring in</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 03:14</strong></p>
<p>Yea we wanted to be slow with this. Not bring too much attention too fast</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 03:14</strong></p>
<p>That's smart.&nbsp; If it gets out as to what I'm doing you might be on your own.</p>
<p>I'm certain necromancy is already looking through the email to find a connection to me.&nbsp; It's only a matter of time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you're in a department the real investigation can begin.&nbsp; Until then I might have occasional work for you.&nbsp; Once there though you'll need to gain trust, maybe work towards a promotion or two.&nbsp; Be careful though because you're on the field research track, they might even recruit you for project grindstone.&nbsp; It's all been so hush hush here though.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 03:35</strong></p>
<p>Oh Peach if you're still here, or just whenever you get back, I wanted to ask what you knew about Researcher Marino? Just so that we can round off who all the researchers might be on our end</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 03:54</strong></p>
<p>Researcher Marino?&nbsp; Not a whole lot.&nbsp; She is a fast talker but I've never seen her.&nbsp; I hear she is also human though.</p>
<p>Looks like another reached out to me.&nbsp; they haven't responded to me yet though.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 03:59</strong></p>
<p>Hmmmmm so a fast talker and likely human. Anything else in particular? Like what she does or how she might have worked with Hyles or March or Freeman?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 04:00</strong></p>
<p>I've been in contact with another who might be willing to help. I didn't give them the way in, so we can be sure they're ready to help. Only gave them a clue on how to understand you</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:00</strong></p>
<p>I don't think she has worked with any of them... I also don't know what the researchers do in your plane.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 04:03</strong></p>
<p>I could dig around a bit to see if she's mentioned Grindstone at all, that tends to be what's lead people to this server.</p>
<p>Also the researchers in our plane are mostly performers</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:04</strong></p>
<p>Those are clues at least.</p>
<p>I know there has been increased contact with the Wizard's Whimsy in town and they have a local theater attached to it like a barnacle.&nbsp; I might take a break from the employee records and poke around there tomorrow to see if there is anything I can find.</p>
<p>This Brandon fellow doesn't seem to be saying much.&nbsp; Maybe the interference is the problem.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 04:10</strong></p>
<p>He's probably just trying to take a crack at deciphering how your messages appear on our end. TheShades gave him a cryptic but pretty helpful clue</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:10</strong></p>
<p>Smart, we need trustworthy but also capable individuals to help here.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 04:11</strong></p>
<p>Exactly. We had to figure out how to decode your posts, so if Brandon plans to help us, he should know how to do the same. I'm helping as much as I can, but I won't give it away</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 04:11</strong></p>
<p>Exactly. We had to figure out how to decode your posts, so if Brandon plans to help us, he should know how to do the same. I'm helping as much as I can, but I won't give it away</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:12</strong></p>
<p>I'm sorry I can't be of more help with Marino.&nbsp; If any names come to mind you want me to search on my end then I can do that.</p>
<p>The connection I take differs some days.&nbsp; I worry that I might not be understood on those days.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 04:15</strong></p>
<p>We understand you fine. We've learned how to decode your transmissions pretty efficiently.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 04:16</strong></p>
<p>We've worked out how to decipher your messages quite easily, it's no bother.</p>
<p>If transmission ends up weird then it's fine, we just try something new. I actually managed to unscramble your interfered message earlier, I don't know if you're just giving us license to hack into UMAD but I guess if we can't technically get caught then it might not be a bad last resort</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:19</strong></p>
<p>Let's just not get ahead of ourselves.&nbsp; I'm not sure what you mean by hacking or if it's even really safe.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 04:20</strong></p>
<p>Oh it most definitely isn't safe, we probably wouldn't even be able to do it though since it's all extraplanar</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 04:20</strong></p>
<p>Hacking is when we use programming to access a system we shouldn't have access to. We're not ready to do that yet, but if need be, we'll consider doing so to learn more about UMAD's plans</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:24</strong></p>
<p>You're a programmer?&nbsp; How far in your study are you?&nbsp; Are you making aetherial structures yet or are you more the practical caster?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 04:27</strong></p>
<p>It's not quite the same. We use simple typed code on our more basic systems. However, if they are connecting to our systems, we might be able to reverse that, and connect theirs using our own tech. In any kind of system, there's often a backdoor that can be accessed. And with this kind of crossing of technology, there's bound to be something we can access our way</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:28</strong></p>
<p>Interesting...</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 04:28</strong></p>
<p>Oh our programming is a lot more different to yours it seems, I'm not exactly well-versed in it but I do know how to make the words "Hello World" appear on a screen. It's mostly done by sitting at a computer and entering commands to make it do certain things, a bit like using a mechanical construct I'd imagine</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:29</strong></p>
<p>Advanced programming techniques are the specialty of necromancy but the theory is strongest in aetherial studies.&nbsp; Maybe information can be found there.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 04:31</strong></p>
<p>I get the Feeling we'll have to show him how our tech works, so that he can understand better how it's weird to us that their more magic based tech can even interact with ours. Based on what you've taught us, it shouldn't even be possible for you to talk with us like this. Yet, here we are. So how is this possible? Once we understand that, we might have a grasp on what we can do with it.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:32</strong></p>
<p>Maybe it's planar overlay...</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 04:32</strong></p>
<p>That might be a good idea, if you have a better understanding of how our methods of communication work then we might get to understand how you interact with it and how you communicate as well</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:33</strong></p>
<p>We could certainly give it a try?</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 04:35</strong></p>
<p>Ok so the way that we communicate with each other over long distances using the internet is typically with a device called a computer, and they look like this</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:431px;"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/OrDTHZWWfjtRL3eCPmYAHxJhgd0qI2vlIVAV0I6Noiez72EjrwV4dU-hz_kdshL-jTA8iWBHlP3xK7MsgazKksweuL5TfqSUhBY8FJx9t8Dvgm7F88D-UZhKMOUbettbL36FuaNJ"></figure>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 04:35</strong></p>
<p>Let me see how I can explain this.</p>
<p>Unlike your use of Corpses and Necromancy, our Communication Technology uses simple mixes of Metals, Silicon and Electricity to send signals from one point to another. Even our Visual Monitors use a Liquid Crystal, like Quartz, to convert those signals to a visual form.</p>
<p>We use a Plastic Keyboard to input our commands and text.</p>
<p>Since you have access to our Google Search Engine, you can easily research "Computer" and find out more specific details about how it works.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:37</strong></p>
<p>Plastic?&nbsp; Is that a mirror on the device?</p>
<p>I'll look into computer more.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 04:38</strong></p>
<p>Plastic is a man-Made material using Petroleum Oil compressed into pellets, that are then melted and molded into different objects. Again, Google can tell you more.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:39</strong></p>
<p>I...see...</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 04:39</strong></p>
<p>I'd also recommend researching the history of the internet so that you can get a better idea of how we communicate with each other through our computers</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 04:40</strong></p>
<p>I feel like we are going to frequently get side tracked trying to explain each other's worlds.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:40</strong></p>
<p>Computers seem to transmit messages in a similar way to our air elementals.&nbsp; I will say, this is the fastest way I've ever seen to communicate even if there are some problems with it.</p>
<p>Well, I live here so if you have questions about my world I can try my best to explain.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 04:42</strong></p>
<p>I know, it's vastly different from what you use in your world. Like i've said, magic and the Divine doesn't exist in our world. The only divine thing we have is religion, and even that isn't all too consistent, with groups withing groups of different beliefs.</p>
<p>I will warn, our Internet has a lot of misinformation being posted by people with their own agendas. If you want the best starting point, lookup "WikiPedia" it's a digital encyclopedia that is edited by users, but is often a reliable source for the kind of information you'd seek</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 04:44</strong></p>
<p>Oh peach, i just had a thought. You work in umad right? Atleast as a cover. What department are you assigned to?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:46</strong></p>
<p>There are only ten characters used in the script of the encyclopedia?&nbsp; I'll have to learn the script.&nbsp; Religion is very confusing here as well.&nbsp; So many denominations and with the frequent consul I'm surprised anyone knows what any domain really means.&nbsp; Also all the arguing of which god owns what domain...&nbsp; Then there are questionable agendas with some of the clergy I find.&nbsp; Ultimately however direct guidance is a difficult thing to provide people so I suppose it makes a lot of sense.&nbsp; It is a matter of faith after all.</p>
<p>I don't work here as a cover.&nbsp; I came here to be a researcher.&nbsp; As for my department...&nbsp; For my security that might be best to be kept to myself for now.</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 04:48</strong></p>
<p>A matter of faith is a good way to put it here too.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:48</strong></p>
<p>I think Doublelock worshippers have it right.&nbsp; No organized faith at all.&nbsp; At the same time it can be a little confusing but then again no one can know what Doublelock wants.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 04:49</strong></p>
<p>Wait... DoubleLock? That was the First Password we deciphered. Tell us more about them</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 04:49</strong></p>
<p>Wait wait wait, Doublelock? What kind of domain does Doublelock have?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:49</strong></p>
<p>I'm not a religious scholar as you can see so I am speaking of ignorance and do apologize.</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 04:49</strong></p>
<p>So wait you want to expose umad but youre a researcher by choice? Doesnt that seem contradictory?</p>
<p>Oh snap yes. More on Doublelock if you would.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:53</strong></p>
<p>Doublelock? They are the god fate, absolute concepts, and intellectual immortality.&nbsp; In the beginning they left time to be seated in the center of all things.&nbsp; There is no interaction with them at all, they just are.&nbsp; They wait outside of time for the end to occur where he also is.&nbsp; No one is certain of how to clearly find their perpetuity after judgement so those who worship them simply attempt to find intellectual immortality and be remembered forever.&nbsp; The consequence of this is always great but not always beneficial to others.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 04:56</strong></p>
<p>Intellectual immortality? Usually for our plane that means being accredited towards making some kind of scientific advancements, which sometimes isn't beneficial to other people. How do people try attain intellectual immortality?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 04:56</strong></p>
<p>Doesn't sound all that much different than some of the Religions practiced in our world. Worshiping an Immortal Being, seeking to be remembered forever. We know plenty here who would fit perfectly in DoubleLock</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:56</strong></p>
<p>I came here to be a researcher but found myself growing in concern with recent developments.&nbsp; UMAD intends to protect us but I question their actions sometimes.&nbsp; They are practical, always, but rarely consider a non value based approach to things.&nbsp; Accounting is responsible for defining the value of most things.</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 04:56</strong></p>
<p>The god of fate stuck at the end of time? I can see why followers would want to be remembered forever then</p>
<p>So you support their goal but not their methods?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 04:58</strong></p>
<p>So basically, they are Strictly Logic-Based. They have no ethics or empathy, even though their cause is a good one. Yeah, we have a saying for that based on one of our Religions: "The Road to Hell is Paved with Good Intentions"</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:58</strong></p>
<p>In death you will be judged by Qoseem and find yourself closest with the domains you perpetuate.&nbsp; If you did not commit yourself to service of the god in alignment with your service you find yourself in the realm on Ananakaeia.&nbsp; For those who do not commit to worship however they see a much worse fate...</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 04:59</strong></p>
<p>Can we ask what kind of fate?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:59</strong></p>
<p>Value based ethics are their bread and butter.&nbsp; Simple good, destructive of good, and not applicable in value considered.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 05:02</strong></p>
<p>So a classic utilitarian kind of mindset? "Humankind is governed by two sovereign masters: pleasure and pain?"</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 05:02</strong></p>
<p>They say Doublelock wrote all things.&nbsp; This however was pointless as there was a spread of uncertain phenomena when The Scoundrel bestowed part of themself to all that would be sentient giving us free will.&nbsp; Doublelock became god whose purpose in creation was moot.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 05:04</strong></p>
<p>Wow, this sounds eerily like one of our most prominent religions on earth. A God that governs all, a being that sacrificed themselves to give us choice. We have something like that ourselves, albeit slightly different. Just goes to show how similar we can be</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 05:07</strong></p>
<p>Not as such.&nbsp; Language is a set of domains with expressed values.&nbsp; Take for instance the word cup, there are values that create cup which in of themselves are sets of values.&nbsp; We call this the definition or the domain where the sets that occupy the definition to be the sub-domains of cup.&nbsp; The good is that which achieves the definition of the object.&nbsp; A god is perfectly and most beautifully it's domains.&nbsp; Beauty being that which is strictly its domains and nothing more where perfection is being complete in the domain.&nbsp; For instance if a set was the values 1, 4, and 9 then the values to the set 1, 4, 9, and 11 would be perfect but not beautiful.&nbsp; UMAD exists as an entity dedicated to a singular good, the good of the our plane and its protection.</p>
<p>A good is simply that which promotes the domain.&nbsp; That which destroys a goods is malicious.&nbsp; UMAD exist as a beneficent entity but with a singular goal.&nbsp; This by perspective can often been seen as malicious however.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 05:11</strong></p>
<p>My thought's exactly. They don't see other potentials, laser focused on the one, when others might be more beneficial. One has to be open to all possibilities. It's something us Humans struggle with every day.</p>
<p>Didn't think we'd be debating philosophy in here today.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 05:12</strong></p>
<p>sometimes it's necessary.&nbsp; See wartime, the death of a person is a loss of good but in death they might promote another ideology.&nbsp; This is true of most actions.&nbsp; UMAD just has the power to do...a lot.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 05:15</strong></p>
<p>We know this all to well. The Sacrifice of life for the promotion of our ideals. The Country I reside in pretty much lives by that mindset, to a fault admittedly. And those with power often determine what those Ideals are, or worse: how they should be realized. No one person or group should have that much power.</p>
<p>Another old saying of ours: "Power Corrupts, and Absolute Power Corrupts Absolutely". We've seen all to well how true that is</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 05:15</strong></p>
<p>I step away and we are discussing philosophy? Never a dull moment for the PITS team lol</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 05:16</strong></p>
<p>PITS is the name we made for us: the Peach Investigation and Tactics Squad.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 05:16</strong></p>
<p>Rameus would agree with you.&nbsp; That's why our government powers were divided when he came into power.&nbsp; I just think he did too little for his seat and too much for UMAD…</p>
<p>That's a very fun name!&nbsp; I love it!</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 05:17</strong></p>
<p>Awwwwwww I'm glad you like it</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 05:18</strong></p>
<p>Rameus seemed like a good man. Sadly, those who are filled with greed can easily manipulate good men to get what they want.</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 05:18</strong></p>
<p>Is, or was, Rameus your leader then?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 05:19</strong></p>
<p>Royalists would disagree with you.&nbsp; My country has changed so drastically over the last few years.&nbsp; We are trying to relearn how to live and are trying to rebuild from the revolution.</p>
<p>Rameus is our current King.&nbsp; If you can call him a King?&nbsp; It's uncertain.&nbsp; He certainly looks like one but not like any we had before.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 05:22</strong></p>
<p>My country had something similar to that at one point, he called himself The Lord Protector. Essentially all he did was stamp out a lot of royalist sentiment and imposed a lot of religious restrictions on things people used to enjoy, as he deemed them "sinful".</p>
<p>What kinds of things has Rameus done?</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 05:23</strong></p>
<p>Im going to be heading out, fyi, but i look forward to catching up tomorrow</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 05:24</strong></p>
<p>Oh yeah no worries, I definitely need to be heading out too soon</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 05:28</strong></p>
<p>Rameus eliminated the flesh trade and created a system of free education for those who could safely travel to the institution but they only accept the young to begin molding them or older people who pass examinations.&nbsp; He ended the restriction on aetherial education allowing people to learn to become casters.&nbsp; Eliminated the noble class and enacted land reform from the old royalists territories and even those lords who sided with him.&nbsp; He then ended the people's tax allowing people to choose their own profession and permitting free travel.&nbsp; Without direction and people being taxed to the capital city artisans decreased in supply while demand became an all time high.&nbsp; Now there are more Albertians in the highways than ever and people are hungry and don't know how to lead their lives.</p>
<p>He also divided powers within the government but you already know this.</p>
<p>I can confirm there will be an incoming batch of air elementals soon.&nbsp; I'll let you know what I collect.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 05:31</strong></p>
<p>So before Rameus everyone was given a set purpose? I'm going to guess that the purpose you're given aligns with the service of a god like you mentioned earlier?</p>
<p>Ah very good, I'm looking forward to it. I definitely have to get some sleep first but I've still got a few questions in me if that's alright</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 05:35</strong></p>
<p>Back when people were tied to the land the old king Othello would tax baronies a supply of people to be taken to the capital city.&nbsp; From there they would learn a trade and some would remain while others would be sent to other baronies as rewards or out of need.&nbsp; Duke Graves was a favorite of Othello and often took artisans.&nbsp; Few people were taught aetherial casting.&nbsp; The only real escape was to join the Order of the Magus or become a member of the clergy.</p>
<p>Ask away!&nbsp; I'll answer what I can.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 05:39</strong></p>
<p>Ok just a few</p>
<p>1. What was the flesh trade? Those words sound very strange and slightly horrifying to our ears</p>
<p>2. Who were the Albertians?&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. What's the difference between the Order of the Magus and UMAD? Is UMAD a branch of the Order of the Magus?</p>
<p>And then my last question is a hunch that I have regarding who Marino might be</p>
<p>Specifically I think Marino might go by Cami-Cat on our end, it's a bit of a long shot though as she has collaborated with Hyles before and you mentioned you don't think Marino has worked with him</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 05:43</strong></p>
<p>I'll try to answer each of these.&nbsp; The flesh trade is the trade of slaves or components of chill. Albertians worship the god of highway men and grave robbing.&nbsp; They themselves are often are highway men, an unlawful profession that has become very necessary given the state of our nation.&nbsp; The Order of the Magus is certainly not related to UMAD.&nbsp; They are an old order established during the time of the Azalt to act as educators but restricted their teachings to behind closed doors.&nbsp; They were apolitical until very recently.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't know of any researcher named Cami-Cat but she sounds familiar…</p>
<p>Hold on…</p>
<p>I've seen her name before.&nbsp; She was mentioned very briefly.&nbsp; She is not a researcher but she is mentioned by another researcher.&nbsp; I'm looking quickly.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 05:49</strong></p>
<p>Ok that's good, take your time, no pressure</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 05:49</strong></p>
<p>Yes!&nbsp; It's a report by a member of engineering.&nbsp; Their name has been redacted however…</p>
<p>They called her researcher but in the report clarify that she was not a researcher at UMAD...&nbsp; I suppose they worked together elsewhere?</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 05:52</strong></p>
<p>Perhaps perhaps. What was the report on?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 05:54</strong></p>
<p>It was a field work assignment between engineering and the planar department.&nbsp; It's mostly redacted...&nbsp; I'd send a message like I did last time with the UMAD administrative email but it would be too dangerous.&nbsp; Maybe if I can gain access to other systems with a higher clearance I could find a safer way to send this.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before you go Chuck.&nbsp; Can we all agree to keep what I've talked about here between us?&nbsp; I'm not sure if I'm risking our national security talking about this and if UMAD thought I was more of a threat then I would likely disappear much faster.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 05:57</strong></p>
<p>I don't think we have any reason to blab. Unless we felt you were the bigger threat, which I don't see that being the case right now, we need you here to uncover the truth. Our lips are sealed.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 05:58</strong></p>
<p>Oh of course. You seem to know more of the inner workings of UMAD and you haven't been threatening to us, we have no real reason to do so.</p>
<p>I think best to wait until we've gotten our way up the ranks of the departments so that we can crack open more of the higher clearance stuff</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 06:02</strong></p>
<p>I hope the redacted information was still at all helpful.&nbsp; The only other note I can make about the report is it was made in orange ink.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 06:04</strong></p>
<p>Huh, well that's very strange, I'll keep that in mind</p>
<p>It's still quite interesting, even if it didn't lead to Marino</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 06:06</strong></p>
<p>Finding either of these researchers might help the investigation on my side.&nbsp; Just let me know what you find.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 06:09</strong></p>
<p>Sure, if I end up finding anything I'll post it here. Thanks for the help and the history, it's quite interesting hearing about your world and I hope I can return the favour. I'm probably going to head out now, I'm looking forward to taking a crack at the intercepted messages soon. I'll see y'all soon then!</p>
<p><mark class="pen-red"><strong><u>[Peach’s messages appear in reverse Base 64]</u></strong></mark></p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 19:54</strong></p>
<p>Caught something but it'll be a bit before I can send you something that can be worked with.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 20:02</strong></p>
<p>Ok, first thing, your message has been encrypted differently from when you were last speaking, I'm going to assume this is a consequence of you catching something.</p>
<p>Good news is I managed to figure it out, so it's all fine.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:09</strong></p>
<p>That's good.&nbsp; I did connect with you at a new access point I made so maybe that's it?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:11</strong></p>
<p>That explains it. Still, we're able to keep up. So you have some Air Elementals for us to work with, you said?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:14</strong></p>
<p>Not precisely.&nbsp; A not very well known and honestly difficult method of communication is by causing a air elemental to reverberate in a series of transverse waves within their structure.&nbsp; The aetherial net I cast allows the message to be copied as the elemental passes through but it doesn't always hit the net evenly and produces something we call rotational interference.&nbsp; I'm currently picking apart the rotational interference and then translating the sound into proper code.&nbsp; It might take me a bit to get the ciphered message for you to look at.</p>
<p>Any news on new recruits?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:17</strong></p>
<p>Brandon is still struggling with deciphering your transmissions, so I gave him a re-worded clue.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 20:18</strong></p>
<p>Brandon has reached out to you obviously</p>
<p>I tried to get someone who's been fairly active on the server in regards to the cipher, but she hasn't responded to me yet</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:19</strong></p>
<p>That's disappointing.&nbsp; I did get news that Researcher March is meeting with the head of Culture today but the means were uncertain.</p>
<p>Also the content of the meeting I could not find.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:23</strong></p>
<p>And I assume trying to talk to them ourselves would not be advised. I'm already working to meet with Mr. Hyles for his other work, but I guess mentioning our chats would not end well.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:24</strong></p>
<p>I was able to get a quick glance of Janet's ledger.&nbsp; Seems Researcher March also met with Infenal Affairs last week.&nbsp; I also looked into The Whimsy today.&nbsp; The theater has been more active recently.&nbsp; Got word from the staff that a "SC" has become a regular there.&nbsp; That place doesn't get regulars because the service is terrible and honestly the troupe's performance still haunts me.&nbsp; This "SC" has apparently been meeting with both the troupe and UMAD officials.</p>
<p>I must strongly advise not discussing this with him as it might be too dangerous.&nbsp; We do not want either of you suspected and be dropped from the applicant pool.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:26</strong></p>
<p>SC, huh? Seems we have someone else to learn about, and what their involvement is.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:27</strong></p>
<p>Will your meeting be private or will it be accesible on the google in any way?However there might be something we can do with that opprotunity.&nbsp; I'll have to do some digging and think on it.&nbsp; When do you plan on meeting with Researcher Hyles?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:29</strong></p>
<p>I'm in discussion with him via E-Mail, and if he agrees, it'll be on August 24th. We'll be broadcasting a Concert he performed this last weekend, and I'll be in an Voice Chat here, so It'll be on Google's Video Service, Youtube.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:32</strong></p>
<p>I suspect you'll almost be free of the admissions process by then.&nbsp; Maybe you'll be assigned to a department by then?&nbsp; Who knows, they are taking this process very slowly for you and your applicants.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:36</strong></p>
<p>They've been taking their time since you snuck in there with that one E-Mail, so they might be trying to lock down their system to make sure you can't pull that again. Might need to change tactics if you plan to reach out again.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:39</strong></p>
<p>The current tactics of reaching out is hopefully through you all.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:40</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, makes Sense. harder to trace back to you if we're the ones going out there.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:40</strong></p>
<p>I don't suspect they will drag their feet for long however.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:45</strong></p>
<p>Ok, just making sure. I'll begin contacting someone else to see if they will join us</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:46</strong></p>
<p>I might leave soon.&nbsp; I want to see if there is anyway to evesdrop on the meeting safely.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:47</strong></p>
<p>Be Careful. We'll work on what we can here in the meantime</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 21:29</strong></p>
<p>I have a few things I can confirm.&nbsp; Researcher March will be getting involved with your application process by instruction of Janet and the Culture Department.&nbsp; She will also be running another recruitment drive soon.&nbsp; It seems whatever they are doing they need more people for it.&nbsp; I believe she is involved in the aptitude examination as well as the final mission for the application process.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 21:36</strong></p>
<p>So she's not someone we should reveal anything to. But at least we know to be ready for her to appear soon</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Yesterday at 23:22</strong></p>
<p>So we noticed a user named "alyssamarino" just joined the server. Would that be our other person of interest?</p>
