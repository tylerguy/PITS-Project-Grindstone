<p><strong>Peach — Today at 19:24</strong></p>
<p>I've fixed the rotational error.&nbsp; I should have the message to you today.&nbsp; This isn't like any application material ciphers however, this is part of their security.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 19:40</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for your hard work Peach</p>
<p>Maybe whatever is in the message will hopefully help us in the future. Maybe a clue on what's going on with the Project perhaps.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:01</strong></p>
<p>Not certain but at the very least it'll help me understand communication between department heads.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 20:13</strong></p>
<p>Could you remind me who this message is going to and from?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:31</strong></p>
<p>I'm not certain.&nbsp; The message was intercepted by aetherial net and was sent by air elemental.&nbsp; I captured it to use as a sample for the encryption used by UMAD officials outside of my clearance.&nbsp; By having this I hope to lean how to decipher the script efficiently.&nbsp; I need someone to be able to decipher it and explain to me the process.</p>

<p>I mean, I'll try my best if you wanted to share here. I'm pretty sure we all will.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:32</strong></p>
<p>We got this. Might take us a bit, but given we've cracked the codes so far, I think we can pull it off</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 20:32</strong></p>
<p>Or maybe individually communicate with us as to keep it away from the server?</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 20:39</strong></p>
<p>We can at least give it a go</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 23:56</strong></p>
<p>Another messaged me?</p>
