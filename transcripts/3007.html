<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:24</strong></p>
<p>Possibly, I have no given name for researcher Marino.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 00:28</strong></p>
<p>Looking into things similar to the user I found an Alyssa Marino who uses the same profile picture and is a wrestling commentator and professional cereal eater apparently. I'm guessing her commentating is what might have been meant when you said she's a fast talker?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:29</strong></p>
<p>What I meant is she talks fast.</p>
<p>Another person messaged me but they don't seem to be responding to me.&nbsp; Possibly communication difficulties?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 00:31</strong></p>
<p>What we mean is that she is a Commentator, which is where someone talks about what is happening in an event. I assume you've had something like an Arena in your world?</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 00:33</strong></p>
<p>I'm guessing that's Snow, I've pointed her in your direction. I've given her a bit of a cryptic clue along the lines that TheShades did.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:35</strong></p>
<p>The arena in the capital sure.&nbsp; There is also undergound arena fighting.&nbsp; As long as you don't claim it's an honor duel you might not be claimed a felon.</p>
<p>Yes, so she is a referral.&nbsp; I'll keep an eye out.&nbsp; Hopefully either Snow or Brandon find a way to respond to me…</p>

<p>We stopped doing those kind of arenas ages ago. But we do have many Sports that are friendly competetions. We have two forms of Wrestling, where people grapple each other to the ground. Actual wrestling is a major sport, but we also have what is called "Professional Wrestling" Where it's more of a Stage Show, but with people fake fighting (Though they are still very physical), just with stories and characters (Another thing to add to the Goggle Search List). If this is the same Marino that joined the server, she commentates in "Professional" Wrestling, where she calls out the moves they do so the audience can follow along</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:40</strong></p>
<p>Why would you have fake fighting?&nbsp; What do you mean "call out moves"?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 00:45</strong></p>
<p>It's for Entertainment purposes. They still hurt themselves to some extent, but it's all planned and controlled for the most enjoyment and least actual harm. When I say "Call Out Moves", I mean they explain what moves are being performed, so as to get the viewers excited about what is happening as they watch.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:46</strong></p>
<p>Speaking of entertainment purposes you speak with entertainers TheShades?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 00:48</strong></p>
<p>Mostly in Anime, but I have done Interviews, where I sit down and ask questions to the Actors. I've also worked with others like myself who make content for the Internet, like Researcher Hyles. I'm not exactly very popular in that regard, since few have seen what I've made, but i've gotten to work with many other entertainers of different types thanks to what I do.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:50</strong></p>
<p>You were suggesting approaching Researcher Hyles.&nbsp; What did you have in mind?&nbsp; Would it be at this event you had planned?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 00:53</strong></p>
<p>He recently performed a Concert at what we call a Convention, where people of similar interests gather to have fun and meet entertainers from that topic, in my case Anime. I recorded that concert, and will be re-broadcasting it online, and I'm looking to have him join me to talk about it, asking why he chose the songs he performed, and how it felt being on stage at the event.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:55</strong></p>
<p>I'm familar with concerts and with conventions.&nbsp; They might differ in my world however but I'll use the google to look into them more.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 00:58</strong></p>
<p>Fair enough. With how different our worlds have been so far, I'm never if you have stuff similar to our world or not. Better to cover my bases to be safe.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 01:12</strong></p>
<p>Ok, looks like Brandon has figured out how to decode the transmissions. He should be responding to it finally</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:19</strong></p>
<p>My connection has changed since I last spoke with him.&nbsp; Hopefully he will understand me.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 01:21</strong></p>
<p>I've already warned him. Now he knows what to look out for at this point, so it shouldn't be an issue</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:52</strong></p>
<p>He seems to have gone quiet again.</p>
<p>Maybe he doesn't understand the change in communication.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:14</strong></p>
<p>Not quite the convention I know but good perspective.</p>
<p>Is con a typical suffix for these events?</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 02:19</strong></p>
<p>Yeah generally entertainment conventions are shortened to cons here.</p>
<p>What kinds of conventions are you used to?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:23</strong></p>
<p>The conventions I'm used to usually involve a number of people stuffed into small chambers to discuss policy and forget the poor exist.</p>
<p>I have seen a list somewhere ehn looking through files and nearly every word had that suffix...&nbsp; I cannot remember where though.</p>
<p>I took it for Culture's attempt at a new command speak.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 02:27</strong></p>
<p>What do you mean by command speak? Do you remember what the report was about?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:30</strong></p>
<p>A short speak used during confrontation.</p>
<p>It was just a list as far as I could tell.&nbsp; It's been about a season since I've seen it.</p>
