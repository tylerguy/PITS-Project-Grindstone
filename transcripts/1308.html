<p>peach are you sure this is right</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:13</strong></p>
<p>?</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 01:13</strong></p>
<p>it's been 2 hours</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 01:13</strong></p>
<p>No E-Mail from them yet</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 01:13</strong></p>
<p>what he said</p>
<p><strong>Tylerguy — Today at 01:13</strong></p>
<p>your source might have been incorrect</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:13</strong></p>
<p>Hmmm....</p>
<p>Maybe it's not an email they had planned.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 01:14</strong></p>
<p>Then what are we looking out for?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:17</strong></p>
<p>All I know is that they were planning on continuing the recruitment process and that some researchers assisting with that.</p>
<p>and who knows... maybe plans have changed after recent developments.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 01:25</strong></p>
<p>Perhaps. We've checked any possible place they might have posted an update, but nothing's turning up, so maybe they held off due to the leak</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:26</strong></p>
<p>Possibly…</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:49</strong></p>
<p>Probably regrouping today</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 01:50</strong></p>
<p>Well Crap. I was actually looking forward to solving some puzzles today.</p>
<p>Wait, We think we know what it was. CO just tweeted about the Project, so it wasn't the second Mission they were starting, but the Second Recruitment</p>

<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:57</strong></p>
<p>Looks like it.&nbsp; Any others helping with recruitment?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 01:58</strong></p>
<p>None that we can find. We've checked all the other known researchers and staff (Lizzie, Hyles, SC, Janet, and March), but none of them are posting about it</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 01:59</strong></p>
<p>Caleb did it not that long ago so I doubt he’d do it again this soon</p>
<p>He’s not the type to drive something that hard</p>
<p>Can’t speak for the rest</p>
<p>Cami is probably keeping quiet so as to not reveal her involvement just yet</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 02:31</strong></p>
<p>So, I found another one. I opted to look through other discord members' twitters if they had it posted. Only the online ones atm, cause thats a fair number of names to comb through but anyways.</p>

<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 02:31</strong></p>
<p>Another name I don't recognize</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:31</strong></p>
<p>So they are part of this. Wonder which of the names they are.</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 02:32</strong></p>
<p>What were the names we still wanted to figure out?</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 02:33</strong></p>
<p>Hanford, Mann, and Khan</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 02:33</strong></p>
<p>Well thats Laidlaw. May not be one of those 3</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 02:33</strong></p>
<p>Unless he's operating under an alias</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 02:34</strong></p>
<p>Possibly</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Yesterday at 19:52</strong></p>
<p>I wonder what the situation over at UMAD is. Think they found anything?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Yesterday at 19:53</strong></p>
<p>We'll only know if Peach tells us what's going on, though they need to lay low, to avoid suspicion</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Yesterday at 19:55</strong></p>
<p>I know. But I am a little worried. Peach has been pretty quiet lately. Of course for all I know, they need to set up new elementals or whatever means they use to communicate with us</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Yesterday at 19:56</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, with everything on High Alert, They'll have to make adjustments to avoid getting spotted. We just have to trust they're doing fine. Not much we can do to help from here</p>
