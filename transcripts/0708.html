<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:01</strong></p>
<p>I might have to ask around culture.&nbsp; I'm geographically challenged.</p>
<p>Although...&nbsp; I don't know who I could ask.</p>
<p>Maybe I should look into reference?&nbsp; That sounds like a long night though.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 00:02</strong></p>
<p>Well, if it helps, the name of the image mentions the name Obelus City.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:02</strong></p>
<p>Ohh.....&nbsp; I know of Obelus.</p>
<p>Well I know of it.&nbsp; I can probably get something drudged up on it pretty quickly.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 00:03</strong></p>
<p>There's also an Obelus Kiln?</p>

<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 00:03</strong></p>
<p>If they're using this image on the website, clearly there's a significance, so anything you can learn will help.</p>
<p>They may even attempt to recreate this city for the Minecraft Mission, so this could be helpful</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:03</strong></p>
<p>Funeral Kiln for cremation.&nbsp; Pretty common.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 00:04</strong></p>
<p>Oh. So that thing is a mortuary. Good to know</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 02:21</strong></p>
<p>'I honestly forgot about the phone number. Umad seems to be very specific on what they do and dont want us to collaborate on though, if the earlier test link is anything to go by. If you think theres something we need to know maybe message someone through dm's until we know more one what is and isnt ok to share?'</p>
<p>In regards to Bombadil's message to me. And reminding me i was supposed to mention that we should limit public messaging on certain topics. Thoughts on my phrasing? @Peach ?</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 02:35</strong></p>
<p>Careful @TheShades , make sure you can defend the name drops without info from this side.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:36</strong></p>
<p>I got that covered. Don't worry</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 02:38</strong></p>
<p>Solid</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 03:03</strong></p>
<p>Hey Peach do any of these places seem familiar? They're on the Terms and Conditions, Privacy Policy, and FAQ's section of the website respectively</p>

<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 03:58</strong></p>
<p>Hey Peach, does the term 'Lamented Liens' mean anything?</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 03:59</strong></p>
<p>Or the initials KF?</p>
<p>Janet sent out the 2nd mission. We got really excited and took the too obvious answer as our first guess, then took a closer look and realize we misstepped... Probably getting our files docked for both being wrong and answering when asked to wait but... we will fix it.</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 04:23</strong></p>
<p>Hows this for a cryptic hint/warning?</p>
<p>'After the incident with Leslie im not sure how good it is to freely share information, if umad is quick to ax links they send once theyre made known. But I will say its important to inspect things closely. Dont stop at surface level.'</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 04:24</strong></p>
<p>Wait where did you get that?</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 04:27</strong></p>
<p>He wrote it</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 04:27</strong></p>
<p>Thats what im thinking of sending in general</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 04:27</strong></p>
<p>ah ok</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 04:28</strong></p>
<p>To both hint at insepcting elements and to not be too quick to message general with answers and random umad links</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 15:47</strong></p>
<p>I see I came back to quite a bit.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 15:47</strong></p>
<p>Sorry, we found quite a bit</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 15:47</strong></p>
<p>After the new mission dropped, we really started digging around.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 15:48</strong></p>
<p>So what should I address first?</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 15:48</strong></p>
<p>I mean I guess go from the first one and go down to make it easiest.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 15:49</strong></p>
<p>Did Butcher send that message out?</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 15:49</strong></p>
<p>No people found the code before he sent it out so there's no need.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 15:50</strong></p>
<p>Though we are wondering if we should look into bringing in more members here as a backup. We've seen a few potential candidates in this new crop of people, and We can already clear a few as safe</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 15:51</strong></p>
<p>Those just look like some mines to me.&nbsp; I've never seen that house but Seawell is a coastal town in the far South East of my country.&nbsp; It's a loop point.&nbsp; The Othello Wall was the name of the wall protecting the capital city before the revolution.&nbsp; After it was heavily damaged parts of it were rebuilt and the exploited weaknesses saw fortification.&nbsp; Now it's the Rameus wall.</p>
<p>Lamented Liens is a company within Dial actually.&nbsp; Rental constructs and secured loans from what I recall.&nbsp; Although I've never personally been there so maybe I'm mistaken?</p>
<p>I'd absolutely encourage more people on here.&nbsp; If we only have one to each department the lack of redundancy might be dangerous.&nbsp; What if one of us is found or is unable to perform?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 15:56</strong></p>
<p>Ok, then I offer a Suggestion: When they contact you, don't translate for them. We need to test them to make sure they're ready for what's to come.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 15:56</strong></p>
<p>I agree</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 15:58</strong></p>
<p>I suppose I can do that.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 15:58</strong></p>
<p>Alright, was there anything you found from the Quill in Planar?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 15:58</strong></p>
<p>Alright, I'll reach out to some potentials and see what we can get.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 15:59</strong></p>
<p>Haven't checked it yet.&nbsp; The boss had me working until Kadmin rose.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 15:59</strong></p>
<p>Oh my you haven't had any sleep then huh?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 15:59</strong></p>
<p>I have...&nbsp; a little.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 16:00</strong></p>
<p>Well get that Orzo then lol you'll probably need it</p>
<p>If you haven't drank a ton already</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 16:02</strong></p>
<p>I was just thinking of grabbing some.&nbsp; Apparently rats got into the Barley though so I'll need to go to the Whimsy to get some.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 16:02</strong></p>
<p>Awwwwww</p>
<p>That really sucks</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 16:03</strong></p>
<p>It's not a far walk but everything feels far when you're tired.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 16:03</strong></p>
<p>I feel that</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 16:03</strong></p>
<p>I blame alchemy for the rat problem</p>
<p>Transmogrification potions for heightened fluid and crystalized intelligence.&nbsp; Exciting idea but not very efficient to test on rats if you ask me.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 16:05</strong></p>
<p>Testing on Rats. Not to far removed to what our Scientists do here</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 16:05</strong></p>
<p>And the first the thing they thought was 'TO THE BARLEY!' haha</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 16:06</strong></p>
<p>Barley is healthy stuff.</p>
<p>Anyways, to the Orzo!</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:01</strong></p>
<p>Back</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 18:01</strong></p>
<p>Welcome back</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:01</strong></p>
<p>More planar notes</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 18:01</strong></p>
<p>What we got?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:03</strong></p>
<p>First of all I think I have everything I need to get a clearance doc made but as I mentioned before we need to plan it around the incoming and outgoing department heads.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 18:04</strong></p>
<p>I guess we have to hear news of one leaving before we can make a move</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:04</strong></p>
<p>Second, I found the previous head of Planar is to be pronounced deceased soon.&nbsp; It doesn't seem like there is a clear cause of death however.&nbsp; At least none UMAD has listed, or should I say decided on.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 18:05</strong></p>
<p>I'm assuming the real reason wasn't Accidental, then</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 18:05</strong></p>
<p>Oh no, Genevieve didn't make it. Maybe she was she was getting close to something she shouldn't.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:05</strong></p>
<p>Some of these transcripts suggest determining an irregular cause of death that doesn't warrant investigation.</p>
<p>The Planar department goes through a lot of department heads.&nbsp; It happens almost weekly.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 18:06</strong></p>
<p>The Planar department is dangerous after all so it's to be expected</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:06</strong></p>
<p>The curious thing about this one is the next head has a very high clearance and the death of the previous was fabricated.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 18:07</strong></p>
<p>So she's still alive?</p>
<p>Or cause of death fabricated?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:07</strong></p>
<p>It could be as simple as she passed due to something they couldn't disclose or maybe she isn't dead?</p>
<p>It's unclear.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 18:08</strong></p>
<p>Interesting</p>
<p>What else did you find?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:09</strong></p>
<p>Well, Hanford came up again in communication.&nbsp; I attempted to check the personnel files and yet again it's missing from my clearance level.</p>
<p>Found a few notes on how they intend to utilize the technology for extra planar exploration during your mission.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 18:11</strong></p>
<p>Oh that'll be helpful!</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:12</strong></p>
<p>Also I've found the five dimensional spatial coordinates of the plane.&nbsp; I cross referenced this and came up with little.&nbsp; I did learn that it was a place of active exploration only a season ago but get this, it was inter-departmental as well.</p>
<p>The plane had similar but not exact Belthidian laws to ours.&nbsp; It limited aetherial pull among other things.</p>
<p>Flora and fauna records were redacted.&nbsp; I found a note about first communication meaning there must be intelligent life there however.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 18:15</strong></p>
<p>Wait... Do you have the Coordinates? That description might be from our Realm. From past talks, it sounds like either our World, or a Minecraft World.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:15</strong></p>
<p>They likely chose the plane because it was safe and the Belthidian Laws well understood.</p>
<p>How do realms usually look?&nbsp; These coordinates explain space and spatial movement.&nbsp; It's a 5 value system with variable characters attached for estimated movement in the fluid mosaic.</p>
<p>I also have a reference on Obelus.&nbsp; This wasn't part of the quill discoveries, just something I picked up.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 18:19</strong></p>
<p>From the Whimsy or work gossip?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 18:19</strong></p>
<p>Fluid Mosaic? If it's the same as how our world describes it, that involves Cell Membranes. That's on a microscopic level</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:20</strong></p>
<p>From reference, it's a leather-bound with notes on various cities and nations.</p>
<p>The fluid mosaic describes the planar reality.&nbsp; It takes two models to describe the universe with one existing as a disc-like fluid mosaic of planes occupying space within the aetherial matrix.&nbsp; As the aetherial matrix moves the newly created space is filled by the stretching of these planes within 5 dimensional space.&nbsp; The second model is biconical in nature and is an expression of rate-time.&nbsp; The center of the biconical structure shrinks infinitesimally and at it's central point exists space outside of time.&nbsp; This is where it is said Doublelock resides.&nbsp; As objects move away from the center time passes slower in relation to the center.</p>
<p>We call relative space within the disc rings.&nbsp; By convention we call all things at the same relative distance from the center as us but on this side of the biconical structure "ring one"</p>
<p>The center is "ring eight" and therefore where time passes at our rate but on the opposing side of the biconical structure would be "ring fifteen"</p>
<p>your world and mine are both ring one.&nbsp; So is this plane being observed through the minecraft medium.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 18:28</strong></p>
<p>It could be possible, though it might be on a closer ring, since times moves realtively fast in Minecraft. But for us to access a Minecraft world, we either jump into one at Random, or use what's called a "Seed", a series of Numbers that would best be described as Coordinates to a particular Plane in Minecraft, or at least a recreation of it.</p>
<p>Here's what a Seed Number looks like: 2151901553968352745</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:30</strong></p>
<p>That string doesn't have assisting values to denote variables.&nbsp; I don't think the planar coordinates are the same as a seed.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 18:30</strong></p>
<p>Worth a Shot, at least. It might be something else, but we don't have a clue where to look</p>
<p>Most of our coordinates only work on a Three Dimensional axis. We don't have a way to access beyond that</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 18:31</strong></p>
<p>Btw what was described about Obelus?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:40</strong></p>
<p>What would you like to know about Obelus?</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 18:41</strong></p>
<p>What's that tower with the ball on it?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:42</strong></p>
<p>1.1987-611/1.8386+6/1.2238-11/1.9882-664/1.7677+232</p>
<p>Those are the planar coordinates</p>
<p>The ball?&nbsp; Let me check.</p>
<p>You're probably talking about what this book describes as a false moon.&nbsp; A small artificial landmass set adrift above by a combination of aetherial and iasadic methods and used for iasadic veneration for the Moon Patron.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 18:45</strong></p>
<p>Iasadic?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:46</strong></p>
<p>A topic I'd prefer not to get into…</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 18:46</strong></p>
<p>And to be clear this is what I was talking about.</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:100px;"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/fvlQVXmKbkVOkNfupj9h3X8RrYbVAOsimxQ5Yivo_qAPuDsxNg3QCKES6IPa0g3TbbUjBL82rvtjmJgFbsIRyxXUS3W2z0PzN5IvD90IajODNJR4uwTuNNFZgyRgRChbwm4UWP1l"></figure>
<p>Okay that's fine</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:47</strong></p>
<p>That looks like the structure, yes.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 18:47</strong></p>
<p>That's weird though because that picture is what's used for the icon for the Project Grindstone website.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:52</strong></p>
<p>I'm not certain why.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 18:54</strong></p>
<p>Also, to help you get an idea of what they may be up to with Minecraft, it would help if you saw that world as we see it. I took the Coordinates you gave and calculated them into a single number. It was long enough to use as a Seed Number, so I opened up Minecraft, and opened a new world using the Seed. This is where I ended up:</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:358px;"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/gwhos18Kr_1qPRnpuuZkrer-QiCfJg08d3TqksAgO90c06zxXntkVL9EOu3lSP_EcUYRWt2ZeI43loptno_u4SRXzisL5uno7XhbHfN6wMKdqRWWKR7IXFCo7a777qFT5PbflBRN"></figure>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:58</strong></p>
<p>This looks very strange to me.&nbsp; What does it look like on your side?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 18:59</strong></p>
<p>That's it. We don't actually go to the plane. For us, Minecraft is but a game, where we explore this world, and build using the materials around us. This is what it looks like to us.</p>
<p>It's all in Cubed Shaped Objects</p>
<p>Btw, a new person named Megaranger should be contacting you soon. Be ready to test him.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 19:26</strong></p>
<p>Peach, question if I may. Have you ever heard of "Domme Geiten"?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 19:29</strong></p>
<p>I'm not, but it sounds like an Oudste settlement.</p>
<p>They tend to have strange names like that.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 19:30</strong></p>
<p>Indeed. Appearently they have an abundance of goats</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 19:33</strong></p>
<p>Should we move the quill to necromancy or do you think we need to learn more from planar?</p>
<p>What does everyone think?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 19:39</strong></p>
<p>We need to know more about what is planned for the next stage. I'm down</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 19:39</strong></p>
<p>I'm good with that. Provided it doesn't put Peach in trouble</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 19:40</strong></p>
<p>Well between alchemy and necromancy, necro has less security</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 19:41</strong></p>
<p>If you move to Necromancy it'll likely need to be soon but remember that they have the best security.&nbsp; There security has recently lightened up due to the demands for your application process.&nbsp; There is also aetherial studies and alchemy.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 19:43</strong></p>
<p>Okay so necromancy is designing the the next test, while alchemy and atheriel studies are coordinating it, right?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 19:45</strong></p>
<p>They are on the project but as necessary.&nbsp; Planar and Necromancy are doing most of the heavy lifting right now and it seems Culture is always active likely due to the people from your side working on the project.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 19:46</strong></p>
<p>Hmm</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 19:51</strong></p>
<p>You said their security had lightened up due to our application process? Then I say move it. This is our best chance to get info on Necromancy. They'll likely tighten back up once the second phase of recruitment passes</p>
<p>Which would mean increased risk if we wait to do this</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 19:52</strong></p>
<p>Yeah now would probably be the best opportunity if we want anything from that department.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 19:52</strong></p>
<p>Do we have any thoughts on additions to the team?&nbsp; Maybe having an extra person per department would be good to keep redundancy in the event someone is compromised.&nbsp; I don't think anymore is really necessary unless we just want them to bounce ideas off of.&nbsp; Though if someone exceptional comes our way then we should extend the offer.</p>
<p>So move the quill to necromancy?</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 19:53</strong></p>
<p>Please</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 19:53</strong></p>
<p>Agreed on both statements</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 19:53</strong></p>
<p>As for new people, I trust Shades judgement on that</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 19:53</strong></p>
<p>Having teams of two will definitely help increase our chances of finding info as well</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 19:54</strong></p>
<p>I've already sent someone your way. They're from my own community, so I can easily confirm they're safe to bring in if they can pass the test</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 19:54</strong></p>
<p>You have two more missions after the current one and then you're in.&nbsp; Best get the team together before then.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 19:55</strong></p>
<p>Understood</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 19:55</strong></p>
<p>I haven't heard from them yet but I'll hopefully hear soon.&nbsp; I will need to continue inventory today so I will be gone for several parts however, I will move the quill at that time too.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 19:56</strong></p>
<p>Be safe Peach</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 19:56</strong></p>
<p>Okay you do your best Peach</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 19:56</strong></p>
<p>Will do and thank you for your help so far.</p>
<p>Looks like they reached out.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:00</strong></p>
<p>I'm talking with them now myself. I've given them the code hint so send them an untranslated message, and see if they can get it</p>
<p><strong>Sir Gruffles — Today at 20:28</strong></p>
<p>I'm late, but also good with moving quill to necromancy.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 20:48</strong></p>
<p>I agree too, especially since necromancy is involved in making the next mission</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:49</strong></p>
<p>Another contacted me.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 20:52</strong></p>
<p>I have found another potential recruit. They go by the name Eris</p>
<p>So be on the lookout Peach. Remember, don't translate please. We gotta test them</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:53</strong></p>
<p>I think they got it covered</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 21:01</strong></p>
<p>Welcome Eris</p>
<p>Lots to catch up on I'm sure.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 21:02</strong></p>
<p>We're filling her in now.</p>
<p>Also, Megaranger should have responded to you</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 21:02</strong></p>
<p>Yes and I asked them if they would keep the information here private.&nbsp; I haven't heard anything since.</p>
<p><strong>Eris — Today at 21:04</strong></p>
<p>Hi!&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’ll spend some time looking through the messages, but I’ll make sure to learn as much as I can</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 21:04</strong></p>
<p>I'm sending two more people to you Peach, both of them I live with and I know fairly decently, they should be trustworthy</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 21:05</strong></p>
<p>Are they aware that everything must remain confidential?</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 21:05</strong></p>
<p>Yes they are</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 21:05</strong></p>
<p>With them and ranger that would make 10 people.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 21:05</strong></p>
<p>I'm working on one more, but they haven't responded to me yet. Might have to look elsewhere.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 21:06</strong></p>
<p>Two more and we can divide our numbers between all the departments with redundancy.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 21:06</strong></p>
<p>Snow is talking with another</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 21:09</strong></p>
<p>I'll be back.&nbsp; I'm grabbing Orzo.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 21:33</strong></p>
<p>I'm heading into work soon so I'm going silent until late.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 21:47</strong></p>
<p>Back</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 21:47</strong></p>
<p>We got some new Candidates sent your way</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 21:47</strong></p>
<p>Goodness, lots of people reaching out.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 21:47</strong></p>
<p>We've been busy</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 21:54</strong></p>
<p>Ranger should be in soon.</p>
<p>Waiting on the others to respond to me.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 21:54</strong></p>
<p>Welcome Megaranger! Glad you made it</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 21:55</strong></p>
<p>Welcome.</p>
<p>I suppose if this amounts to twelve people helping then we should decide departments yet again.</p>
<p><strong>Sir Gruffles — Today at 21:59</strong></p>
<p>I'm still set with Planar, myself.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 21:59</strong></p>
<p>Cultural, since I have no choice</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 21:59</strong></p>
<p>Still good with Alchemy</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 21:59</strong></p>
<p>Still want engineering</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 22:01</strong></p>
<p>Hi</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 22:02</strong></p>
<p>Adding nobody</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 22:10</strong></p>
<p>Congratulations Gruffles.</p>
<p>May only one eye of Caboumin grace the union.</p>
<p>Welcome Nobody</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Today at 22:14</strong></p>
<p>Hello!</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 22:14</strong></p>
<p>Welcome Friend!</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 22:15</strong></p>
<p>I'm sure the others are filling you in.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 22:16</strong></p>
<p>We are</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 22:17</strong></p>
<p>Still waiting on Zella</p>
<p>They would make 10.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 22:18</strong></p>
<p>We're helping them through as we speak</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 22:19</strong></p>
<p>Can you explain that phrase, peach?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 22:19</strong></p>
<p>?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 22:21</strong></p>
<p>I think he's asking about: "May only one eye of Caboumin grace the union."</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 22:21</strong></p>
<p>^</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 22:21</strong></p>
<p>They are a god of love and hate.&nbsp; The implication is there is bountiful love that persists.</p>
<p>While one could assume the latter that has never colloquially been the spirit of the phrase.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 22:22</strong></p>
<p>So having only one Eye grace them would imply the couple receiving Love from them.</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 22:23</strong></p>
<p>I like that we teach you our short hand slang and we learn your colloquialisms</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 22:23</strong></p>
<p>And expressing and expanding the domain of love.&nbsp; It's most holy in that regard.&nbsp; I'm wishing them the best.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 22:23</strong></p>
<p>I kind of assumed that, but still nice to learn more specifically what it meant</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 22:48</strong></p>
<p>Adding Zella momentarily.</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 22:50</strong></p>
<p>god that was long as hell</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 22:51</strong></p>
<p>?</p>
<p>I don't understand</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 22:52</strong></p>
<p>I think cause it has been a while since anyone talked in here.</p>
<p>ha ha</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 22:53</strong></p>
<p>no the transcript</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 22:53</strong></p>
<p>Oh! We've kept a Transcript of this chat, in case something happens, so we can check things later</p>
<p><strong>Eris — Today at 22:55</strong></p>
<p>Peach, could you please tell me more about the aetherial&nbsp; department?</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 22:55</strong></p>
<p>yeah by the way did you guy find out what "The Answer you seek is f, stay diligent, for more instructions will be coming" meant?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 22:56</strong></p>
<p>I think that even tells us "This will be important later". I suspect the next part of the mission will reveal it's meaning</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 22:56</strong></p>
<p>K</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 23:01</strong></p>
<p>What would you like to know about them?&nbsp; Anything particular?</p>
<p><strong>Eris — Today at 23:02</strong></p>
<p>I’d like to get an idea about what exactly they do beside learning theory</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 23:05</strong></p>
<p>Really it breaks down to the theory and practice of spellcraft.&nbsp; Understanding the aether in a more fine way.&nbsp; Collaborations with engineering lead to a better understanding of the Belthidian laws.&nbsp; After previous conversations and investigations on the google tool I would best describe them as inventors of new spells, students of what you call physics, and theorists of aetherial practice.</p>
<p><strong>Eris — Today at 23:08</strong></p>
<p>I guess I’ll try getting into this department then</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Yesterday at 23:22</strong></p>
<p>@Peach, Cami-Cat is streaming, could you attempt to raid Janet's desk?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Yesterday at 23:22</strong></p>
<p>@Peach JANET's LIVE! We have an Opening!</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Yesterday at 23:22</strong></p>
<p>Yes!!</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 23:23</strong></p>
<p>Really?&nbsp; I'll go now.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Yesterday at 23:24</strong></p>
<p>Try to make a copy of the key to the clearance level 14 cipher if you can, that'll be really useful</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 23:34</strong></p>
<p>Not here long.&nbsp; A little winded but I went as fast as I could without drawing suspicion.&nbsp; She is in fact gone from her desk but there is an aetherial lock on one drawer and physical ones on most others not to mention aetherial eyes are patrolling.&nbsp; I got a solid look at things and it looks like both her in and out boxes are empty.&nbsp; I might be able to work around the eye's patrol but it's risky.&nbsp; Alternatively I can try to find something to dispel them or even the lock.&nbsp; UMAD will absolutely know if I do this however and I'll likely need to look around aetherial studies for something effective enough.&nbsp; As for the physical locks I might be able to pick some products up in alchemy to get an imprint of the lock.&nbsp; That'll allow me to get something made later and come back.&nbsp; Alchemy is near the bottom floor while Aetherial study is near the top however.&nbsp; I don't know how long Janet will be gone but I'll need to be smart about this.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Yesterday at 23:35</strong></p>
<p>Don’t take unnecessary risks Peach. You get caught and it’s game over</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Yesterday at 23:35</strong></p>
<p>If you are going to take a gamble, i feel the magical lock should have priority, so aetherial would get my vote. But as brandon said, its a high risk situation</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 23:37</strong></p>
<p>I'm not the most physically active so I don't know how subtle or stealthy I can be.&nbsp; If I do grab something to dispel UMAD will freak out.&nbsp; The safest thing I can think of is try to create an impression of the lock and try to open it next time but I'm not sure what to do about the eyes.</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Yesterday at 23:37</strong></p>
<p>the eyes?</p>
<p>magical locks are a no go for now i'd say: if they trigger an alert (and most definitely they do), you're very likely to be compromised</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 23:38</strong></p>
<p>Aetherial eyes.&nbsp; Moving aetherial constructs with limited material that give a one way visual of the surroundings to another caster.</p>
<p>Damnit</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Yesterday at 23:38</strong></p>
<p>impression of the physical lock has my vote; that is assuming she doesn't change the locks on a regular basis</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 23:39</strong></p>
<p>I'm also no expert on aeonization magic so I wouldn't know much of what I'm looking for to dispel these.</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Yesterday at 23:39</strong></p>
<p>I see, so they maintain constant surveillance</p>
<p>are the aetherial constructs placed everywhere within the institution, or just Janet's desk?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 23:39</strong></p>
<p>I guess I could suck it up and try to sneak it...</p>
<p>Several locations.&nbsp; Eyes are expensive to make and maintain though so they are limited.</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Yesterday at 23:42</strong></p>
<p>i see. could you feasibly disguise yourself, take a copy of the lock, then take off the disguise once you get back to where there are no eyes?</p>
<p>i'd assume seeing someone in a disguise could also be alerting though</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 23:43</strong></p>
<p>I'm also no expert on disguise...&nbsp; With that said I might have an option.</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Yesterday at 23:43</strong></p>
<p>Oh?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 23:46</strong></p>
<p>Selective transmogrification.&nbsp; I could go to the rat lab and take one.&nbsp; Although they might be wondering where the potion went.&nbsp; I suppose I could cause a small mess and maybe they would blame the rats.</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Yesterday at 23:46</strong></p>
<p>i'm a bit unfamiliar with the term; would that turn you into an animal temporarily?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Yesterday at 23:46</strong></p>
<p>Just be careful. This is a big gamble here, with no promise of payoff. If there's even a chance it's too risky, don't be afraid to back out.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 23:47</strong></p>
<p>It would change me somehow.&nbsp; Hopefully they are clearly labeled.</p>
<p>Or maybe I should cause a distraction?</p>
<p>I understand but it's worth a shot.&nbsp; I just need a solid plan.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Yesterday at 23:48</strong></p>
<p>Go for the Distraction. They'll be less likely to be on the lookout if they're in a bit of a panic</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Yesterday at 23:48</strong></p>
<p>how would you cause the distraction? can it be traced back to you?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 23:49</strong></p>
<p>I could just let the rats out again.&nbsp; They are part of a higher intelligence experiment and we had trouble with them just recently.</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Yesterday at 23:49</strong></p>
<p>that could work</p>
<p>let the rats out, take a potion in the confusion</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Yesterday at 23:50</strong></p>
<p>That's honestly not a bad idea, the rats could work</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 23:50</strong></p>
<p>So let the rats out, get an impression, make a key later, wait for another opportunity, check the desk later?&nbsp; Any objections?</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Yesterday at 23:50</strong></p>
<p>I agree with that plan</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Yesterday at 23:50</strong></p>
<p>Solid. Go For it!</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Yesterday at 23:50</strong></p>
<p>yes, that might do it</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Yesterday at 23:50</strong></p>
<p>So long as you have an impression now then that's what we need, the key can come later</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 23:51</strong></p>
<p>Grab extra potions?&nbsp; I suppose I could do that too.</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Yesterday at 23:51</strong></p>
<p>don't take too many</p>
<p>one or two disappearing in an incident is fine, but people might get extra suspicious if you take more</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 23:51</strong></p>
<p>Not if the inventory is off...</p>
<p>I'll go now</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Yesterday at 23:51</strong></p>
<p>alright</p>
<p>best of luck!</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Yesterday at 23:52</strong></p>
<p>Good luck, may your walls be salted and your floors damp</p>
