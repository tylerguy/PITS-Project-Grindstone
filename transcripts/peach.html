<h2>27th July 2021</h2>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Yesterday at 7:08 PM</strong></p>
<p>Hello</p>
<p><mark class="pen-red"><strong>[Peach’s messages appear in reverse hexadecimal]</strong></mark></p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 7:11 PM</strong></p>
<p>Excellent, glad you're here!&nbsp; I won't be online all the time but any questions you may have I'll do my best to answer them.&nbsp; Before we jump into things I'm sure you have many questions.</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Yesterday at 7:13 PM</strong></p>
<p>So many. First, should I be responding like you do?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 7:17 PM</strong></p>
<p>I'm not certain what you are asking but I'm assuming what I send you comes out a little strange.&nbsp; This is to be expected through unconventional divination.&nbsp; I don't exactly have all the resources that UMAD does to do what I'm doing now.</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Yesterday at 7:22 PM</strong></p>
<p>[Done in reversed hexadecimal] I'm asking if I should respond like this. I assumed it was to hide from UMAD, but now you seem surprised that your message was less than clear.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 7:24 PM</strong></p>
<p>That seems to come through more clearly on my end but it's not necessary.&nbsp; I can adjust for convenience.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Yesterday at 7:29 PM</strong></p>
<p>God this is cool, ok. I'll be in touch.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 7:32 PM</strong></p>
<p>May your walls be salted.&nbsp; We will talk later.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Yesterday at 11:26 PM</strong></p>
<p>So I guess while I wait for anyone else to join us (You noted that you were talking with several others), I notice two of the Server Admins are in here as well. I have to ask what their involvement in this is?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 11:30 PM</strong></p>
<p>The server admins are just artifacts for necessary communication through these unconventional means of divination.&nbsp; Wallflowers, accessories if you will.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Yesterday at 11:34 PM</strong></p>
<p>Ive noticed the admins have never spoken in server, atleast not that Ive seen.</p>
<p>Probably a 'they own the server' thing?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 11:37 PM</strong></p>
<p>Artifacts in aetherial spellcraft happens often.&nbsp; I will need to attend to some things but please ask any questions and as many questions as you want.&nbsp; I'll answer when I come back tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Yesterday at 11:38 PM</strong></p>
<p>Heya</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 11:38 PM</strong></p>
<p>I'll be taking my leave now.</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Yesterday at 11:38 PM</strong></p>
<p>Okay Peach so when you say umad isnt who they say they are, what does that mean?</p>
<p>So wait he leaves just when new people arrive? Uggh cliff hangers...</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Yesterday at 11:40 PM</strong></p>
<p>Lol, just bad timing. Still, we're onto something here, so let's see what they have to tell us</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Yesterday at 11:41 PM</strong></p>
<p>For sure.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Yesterday at 11:41 PM</strong></p>
<p>I suppose that gives us a bit of time to acclimatise to this</p>
<p>Maybe they're talking to someone new, we don't know how many people could've figured out the steganography</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Yesterday at 11:42 PM</strong></p>
<p>Or hell even what timezone theyre in. Doesnt seem to be a bot so, who knows where theyre at in their day</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Yesterday at 11:43 PM</strong></p>
<p>Very true</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Yesterday at 11:46 PM</strong></p>
<p>Also not sure how much to 'think out loud' here either</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Yesterday at 11:47 PM</strong></p>
<p>Yeah true</p>
<h2>28th July 2021</h2>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 1:12 PM</strong></p>
<p>Hello everyone, I'm back.&nbsp; No one else seems to have found my peach file yet.&nbsp; Ah well.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 1:25 PM</strong></p>
<p>On to your first question.&nbsp; First of all I stated they are not what they appear to be not that they are not who they say they are.&nbsp; They very much live up to their mission statement but given the authority permitted to them it doesn't take much time for alternative interests to build especially when operating with extra planar time dilations.&nbsp; I'm a researcher within UMAD and my time here has led me to seeing very concerning activities.&nbsp; It's unusual also for UMAD to consider so many foreign nationals for recruitment at one time as it would be a risk for national security yet there are several dozen of you in the application pool.&nbsp; I suspect what they are doing will be occurring soon.&nbsp; It's my hope that if you were able to find me that you will be able to assist with untangling a few things for me while also trying establish trust and gain acceptance into UMAD.&nbsp; Cross departmental insight might lead to a better understanding.</p>
<p>You can use this channel to keep away from the eyes of UMAD management and to perform cross department information exchange once accepted into a department.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 1:29 PM</strong></p>
<p>Cross departmental insight? So something like trying to find out more about the goings on between the cultural and necromancy department?</p>
<p>We were thinking earlier that the necromancy department seemed suspicious, Pauchik was the one who took down your clue after all</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 1:29 PM</strong></p>
<p>As for the nefarious "what they are doing" I have my suspicions but in an effort to avoid a slander case, which really is a fate worse than being tried with treason, I'd like to confirm my suspicions first.&nbsp; After all, we just met.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 1:34 PM</strong></p>
<p>Wait, "extra planar time dilation"? We're dealing with Potential Time Manipulation here? Yeah, I could see that leading to some Alternate Motives.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 1:35 PM</strong></p>
<p>Culture, Necromancy, Aetherial Study, Planar, Engineering, Alchemy, Infernal Affairs, Accounting, Administration, and Human Resources.&nbsp; Although the latter four are not research departments.&nbsp; When it comes to anyone with authority I think we can write Pauchik off as he is too... Pauchik.&nbsp; He assists with Qosomite divination technologies, communications program repair and insight.&nbsp; He also assists with the occasional construct programming but in all he is a Val whose mind seems to wander much too often.&nbsp; He is also a little gullible and easily scared.</p>
<p>Time manipulation in one direction.&nbsp; Not even gods can turn back the clocks.&nbsp; With Infernal Affairs they could easily utilize Perpetuities of some of the latter rings to make extra time for themselves.&nbsp; In fact we often do during research to make certain deadlines.&nbsp; Alchemy will often collaborate with Planar to see lengthy reactions occur within a reasonable time for instance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 1:40 PM</strong></p>
<p>Wow Deep Stuff. I assumed it wasn't full time control, but even simply slowing down time could have some Massive implications, especially when combined with the other Research being done.</p>
<p>Still, while I don't think we need to consider Pauchik a problem, we should still keep our eyes open. If there is one thing I've learned in my time, it's that ignoring someone like that is never a good idea. With the kind of research UMAD is working on, one bad day with him could lead to some serious issues. Better we work to keep him stable, and possibly make him an Ally. That kind of eccentricity could be beneficial if channeled correctly.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 1:41 PM</strong></p>
<p>If you say so, just try not to get locked into a conversation about his hobbies.&nbsp; Val voices already are hard to listen to and that man can talk.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 1:43 PM</strong></p>
<p>I don't doubt that. Most of us are Geeks ourselves about different hobbies, so we all know what we can be like when given the chance to talk about our favorite topic. We'll be careful about that.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 1:45 PM</strong></p>
<p>Absolutely, I especially love to see someone so passionate about their work and hobbies.&nbsp; It's just the screeching...</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 1:47 PM</strong></p>
<p>So are there any Members of the UMAD staff we SHOULD be worried about? Who's likely our biggest problem here?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 1:51 PM</strong></p>
<p>Well, Janet is much more informed than most people and she reports directly to the Assistant Headmaster but I never see her leave her desk...ever.&nbsp; Day or night when I come in she is still there, the first face you see.&nbsp; She communicates directly with all the departments and seems to be the first to reprimand those who fall out of the dense rules and regulations.&nbsp; She is also the decision maker for who continues on during the recruitment process.&nbsp; She is not the final say in hiring but she has the final say in who makes it to the last stage of the selection process.&nbsp; I've seen her terminate applicants without seemingly any cause.&nbsp; When approached she simply provides the UMAD standard answer for nearly everything "Need to Know".&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then there is anyone in charge of making the decision for declaring the department head of the Planar department.&nbsp; It seems every week we have a new head and it's hardly ever addressed.&nbsp; They disappear, are in accidents, become plane touched, and all sorts of things.&nbsp; Some just aren't talked about.&nbsp; It's like a position made to get rid of problematic people.&nbsp; Luckily you're foreign nationals and so you'll never be promoted to a department head position.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 1:55 PM</strong></p>
<p>Hence your Code Word to get your attention...</p>
<p>So she's one of those types. Yeah, I can see her being an issue. We're gonna have to play nice with her until we get the answers we need. But with the Department Heads being a Revolving Door, that could prove troublesome, as we'll need to learn how to talk with each of them, and some might just be unapproachable. Fun times...</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 1:55 PM</strong></p>
<p>Engineering has been without a department head for some time but that department is all sorts of mucked up.&nbsp; They still keep Meer Soot on staff for whatever reason and assignments aren't assigned by a direct supervisor, they are just handed out on letters.&nbsp; Letters often for "your eyes or alternative visual sensory data processing organ or system only".</p>
<p>Playing nice with Janet won't get you far, it'll just get you anywhere.&nbsp; Lot's of us kiss her feet for the chance to make appointments, get special assignments, all sorts of things.&nbsp; She is one tough Rau.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 1:58 PM</strong></p>
<p>"alternative visual sensory data processing organ or system" so I'm assuming we have some Cybernetics involved here?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 1:58 PM</strong></p>
<p>No one is even certain where she comes from.&nbsp; According to her papers she is a national but her credentials seem inflated to me.</p>
<p>I'm not certain what cybernetics are but some see from alternatives grafts or process visual information in a way that is not the same as "seeing" something.&nbsp; It's hard to understand the simulation of reality for some entities but that is one thing Alchemy and necromancy intersect on quite a bit.&nbsp; There has even been talk of creating a Medical Studies department for proper biological investigations.&nbsp; I shudder at the acquisition measures.&nbsp; We already use many unfortunates and chill in experimentations.</p>
<p>For your viewing pleasure.&nbsp; Pauchik's hobby.&nbsp; Please note this isn't his work but a good example of what he does.</p>

<p><br><strong>TheShades — Today at 2:05 PM</strong></p>
<p>OH DEAR GOD! If this is the kind of stuff he's doing, I shudder to think where that could lead. Now I see why we should avoid talking about his hobbies. I don't think I could stomach the real deal</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 19:15</strong></p>
<p>Well, now we know not to get on Pauchik's bad side at least</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 19:16</strong></p>
<p>I've only seen him angry once.&nbsp; Generally he is one of the happiest researchers I know.&nbsp; Very well adjusted.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 19:17</strong></p>
<p>That's good to hear. Let's hope we can keep it that way</p>
<p>Let's look at other aspects of this. Why would UMAD want to bring in people from all over. I can see not wanting to be TOO local for risk of being discovered, but why such a Broad Net? What is their goal with that?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 19:26</strong></p>
<p>Excellent question.&nbsp; There are so many possible answers but the one commonality you all have in the discord with the exception of the established members there is that you are foreign nationals.&nbsp; I think with how they cast their net they may intend a much larger recruitment drive in the future.&nbsp; A referral by an established member of UMAD and not a recruitment officer can expedite the admissions process but those who are typically have a lower clearance level than those who earned their right the hard way.&nbsp; If they are casting a net over a large area then they might be casting a net for a large catch.&nbsp; If that's so however I wonder why so many.&nbsp; I suppose recruitment numbers have been low for some time and our staffing is... depleting slowly.</p>
<p>Maybe it's the new field project…</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 19:29</strong></p>
<p>New field project?</p>
<p>I guess it must be a pretty big project to warrant this many people. What have you heard about it?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 19:34</strong></p>
<p>Project Grindstone.&nbsp; All I know is it's interdepartmental and the listed project supervisor is redacted.&nbsp; It could be anyone's project.&nbsp; Ever since it was announced people have been strange around the tower.&nbsp; I suspect that many of us are working on it in secret.&nbsp; I feel like it's fostering more suspicion in the workplace however.&nbsp; Not very productive.</p>
<p>Is there any other questions so far?&nbsp; About anything really.&nbsp; At current I'm attempting to access some redacted documents filed under a hire clearance than myself.&nbsp; The difficulty is, it seems the higher ups use a cipher to communicate that I'm not familiar with.&nbsp; My hope is to intercept an air elemental to acquire a sample of it.&nbsp; Using this sample I'll need to find a solution and be provided an explanation on how to solve it.&nbsp; Once I have that I should be able to decipher correspondences on a more secure level.&nbsp; I'm hoping that the new information I can listen in on will provide insight on what might be going on or maybe help me find a way to access those documents.&nbsp; It might just be hopeful thinking but I'm not certain what other direction to take.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 19:42</strong></p>
<p>Why not ask us to help. The Fact we're here now shows we know a thing or two about cracking ciphers. At the very least, I've been good at Identifying what the Cipher is, which points others in the right direction. I bet with even just the three of us together, we'd have a good shot at it.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 19:45</strong></p>
<p>We're happy to give it a go, once I've been clued in on what kind of cipher it can be I'm pretty good at throwing a load of potential solutions at it until I get something coherent.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 19:45</strong></p>
<p>I think that's a good idea.&nbsp; I'll set out an aetherial net to collect correspondence from an air elemental.&nbsp; Once I have the sample I can send it to you.&nbsp; I'll still dig around and maybe get some other work for you while you work on that cipher.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another concern I have is there are only three of you.&nbsp; I was hoping there would be maybe a few more who could find me...&nbsp; Working between departments may be tricky if there aren't enough of us to investigate every department.&nbsp; Doing what I did with the last email however was very risky.&nbsp; I really can't put myself out there anymore.</p>
<p>I did notice you were getting help elsewhere TheShades.&nbsp; Collaboration might be important but having more people I can directly contact could be just as helpful.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 19:49</strong></p>
<p>We've actually been talking amongst ourselves (So as not to clutter this chat), and we've considered reaching out to a few others who we know could help from the main chat, without saying anything publicly.</p>
<p>Hell, We could even use that little slip up you just did of going in the Voice Chat as a starting point :stuck_out_tongue:</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 19:50</strong></p>
<p>Yeah... I do that a lot.&nbsp; Just be careful how you go about it.&nbsp; To clarify how I saw you looking for help, it was a "reddit" about three weeks ago I think?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 19:51</strong></p>
<p>Ahh yes, the Game theorists. MatPat has made his own ARGs, after having worked to solve so many, so if there is any group of people who could help, it'd be them. It's a matter of how to bring them in here without UMAD seein it</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 19:51</strong></p>
<p>A little off topic but im trying to catch up. I noticed a few words dont seem to translate well. Things like Rau and Val. What are those?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 19:52</strong></p>
<p>Also a "terranova2552" looking for help but I'm not certain who that might be.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 19:52</strong></p>
<p>Not familiar with that name, but i'll look into it</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 19:53</strong></p>
<p>If your recruitment process was anything like mine they will allow you to invite additional assistance with each stage of your application.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 19:54</strong></p>
<p>Getting them into the Main Channel may not prove too difficult. It's more about getting them to you is the issue. Thankfully, I might have a slim chance to contact Matpat himself, since I used to work with him in his very early days. Let me see what I can do with that.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 19:55</strong></p>
<p>You are extraplanar so I suppose you don't have Rau or Val.&nbsp; Maybe you call them something else?&nbsp; I'd send picture examples if I had them.&nbsp; Unfortunately images I send from where I am just become a garbled mess before it even goes to send.&nbsp; I can access images from your Qosomite system however.&nbsp; "Google" is the channel I frequent.</p>
<p>UMAD however seems to have access to an ability to communicate clearly AND send images.&nbsp; Maybe I can find a way eventually.&nbsp; The key will be doing it safely.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 20:00</strong></p>
<p>I do know a couple of people on this server already who are quite good at codebreaking and might be able to help us out, and I've also been checking to see who's been looking for extra clues around Project Grindstone, inspecting source code and things like that.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:01</strong></p>
<p>Val are something like this except... different.&nbsp; I'm not sure how this creature is gripping anything.&nbsp; He looks like a child Val but an adult?&nbsp; Although I couldn't designate an origin to this one like other Val either.</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:433px;"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/D3htuvI9FRdF7WgpVikdy5unOSZGqrqFIdOAprxKG_S0w0gjeW0kGiJyw_7IsC9lVmF1mK8BmNU79xXlzEHoBSR3aqS8yPQa2c_dLnOuwGS4AC6859vINmdaViT4XMDOvS2myKDP"></figure>
<p>Might be useful.&nbsp; The application process will only get more difficult and we need people who can ascend through the ranks within UMAD and gain their trust.&nbsp; I'm not sure how they are handling the physical for you come to think of it...</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 20:08</strong></p>
<p>Huh, interesting. Honestly I don't know how it's gripping anything either, those limbs are not supposed to work like that.</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 20:09</strong></p>
<p>Im more interested in the message that appeared for a sec. One of your 'wallflower artifacts' seemed to poke in.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 20:10</strong></p>
<p>You mentioned something called Qosomite, and that you go to "channels" on it, including Google. Is it something similar to what we'd call the internet?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:18</strong></p>
<p>Qosomite?&nbsp; It means having to do with Qoseem.&nbsp; God of communication, death, efficiency?&nbsp; Any system of aetherial programming meant for communication is called a Qosomite system.&nbsp; It's a little on the nose but it works for explaining what it does.&nbsp; Currently I'm utilizing a constant aetherial draw with tertiary input for purpose of a conceptual link to extraplanar but time adjacent communication.&nbsp; In a way my messages are being fed in part way through a circuit that your people have developed to allow for me to communicate with you.&nbsp; It's not perfect as you can see however.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This system is very impractical but necessary given our situation.&nbsp; I just hope that the constant summation does not make me too conspicuous.&nbsp; I try to change my draw point without changing the point of aeonization to keep my location private however.</p>
<p>I do have to re-establish the programing each time which can be daunting but I've gotten pretty quick at it.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:22</strong></p>
<p>Explains the fact we have to Decode all your messages. Seems to be a form of what we call "Technomagic", since you're using aetherial lines to connect with our Earth-Based Technology</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 20:22</strong></p>
<p>Sounds like a magical vpn if im understanding it right</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 20:23</strong></p>
<p>We can decode it quite easily, and if you're doing what you can to keep yourself safe then this should still be fine. Whatever works works, right?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:24</strong></p>
<p>Technomagic?&nbsp; Do you mean Construct Crafting?&nbsp; It's an intersection for programmers who graduated beyond simple necromancy and most alchemists.&nbsp; Animated objects that are both material and aetherial in structure through three to five dimensional programming.</p>
<p>I'm not certain what a vpn is but I'll likely use the google channel for many things after our conversation.&nbsp; It's been very informative.</p>
<p>This sounds very dangerous.&nbsp; Does everyone have easy access?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:30</strong></p>
<p>Pretty much. There are Restrictions on what we can access, of course, but it's since become a tool we use in our daily lives. We even been able to make it portable, able to carry devices that can access it from anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:31</strong></p>
<p>That's not very UMAD at all!&nbsp; Exciting in many ways but UMAD originated as an intelligence group during the Ramean Revolution and they are not the quickest or most willing to disperse some information.&nbsp; Maybe this Google has something to do with what they are doing?</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 20:31</strong></p>
<p>A lot of people do, a lot of the population does not. In regards to wealth distribution you need to be born in one of the more rich countries to have access to the Internet, and even then it's not guaranteed. It's been a very useful tool for a lot of us, for better and for worse</p>
<p>.</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 20:33</strong></p>
<p>More or less. Nearly everyone can use the 'qosomite system' as you put it. We essentially have a library of most of the worlds&nbsp; knowledge at our fingertips. But there's a lot garbage to sort through too. Definitely has its pros and cons.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:33</strong></p>
<p>Them using Google is risky for them. It would be very easy for some of us to hack into their systems if they were not aware of any vunerabilities in their constructs, and then all their secrets could be leaked. It happens quite often here, sadly.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:34</strong></p>
<p>This makes a lot more sense to me.&nbsp; Of course the wealthy would have access to the google.&nbsp; I'm not once to talk, I had much privilege growing up.&nbsp; It was my upbringing that gave me the tools necessary to successfully apply to UMAD in the end however.&nbsp; Originally I thought I would be trained in a different art but I'm glad I could get more formal training in this specialty later in life.</p>
<p>UMAD would not be so shortsighted.&nbsp; So maybe it isn't the google.</p>
<p>But I suppose I've been that short sighted...</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:36</strong></p>
<p>Still, if they're using our Internet in anyway, there's a chance there could be a backdoor they are not aware of. It's just a matter of finding it before they do</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 20:39</strong></p>
<p>Are... are we thinking about hacking an interdimensional magical government agency/research academy?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:41</strong></p>
<p>But I suppd�v���B6W'F��v�B�6���r�2'WBF�B6�V�G2�&amp;�F��W2�T�B�2fW'�F�vW&amp;�W2W7V6��ǒ6��6R�B�2�V�&amp;W"�bv�fW&amp;��V�B&amp;��V7G2��7W�6R��R6�wB&amp;RG&amp;�VBf�"G&amp;V6��2f�&amp;V�v��F������vWfW#�se I've been that short sighted…</p>
<p>[Garbled bit when solved] I'm not certain what hacking is but that sounds ambitious.&nbsp; UMAD is very dangerous especially since it has a number of government projects.&nbsp; I suppose you ca n't be tried for treason as a foreign national however?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:43</strong></p>
<p>ummm... Kind of breaking up there. That one seems kind of Garbled.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:43</strong></p>
<p>Likely interference.&nbsp; I'll need to readjust my system in about 20 ticks.&nbsp; I'm not sure how long that'll take.&nbsp; Feel free to ask any questions at all however.</p>
<p>I encourage you to lead others you trust to me so we can expand our numbers a bit.&nbsp; After I head off I'll let you know when I'm back.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 20:46</strong></p>
<p>Thanks for the info, best of luck with the... technical difficulties? Arcane difficulties?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:47</strong></p>
<p>There is nothing arcane with my systems.&nbsp; These are all very new magics.</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 20:47</strong></p>
<p>Youre leaving in 20 ticks? Whats a tick?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:48</strong></p>
<p>About 10 breaths?</p>

<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 20:51</strong></p>
<p>Well that depends on the size of your lungs</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 20:51</strong></p>
<p>What are these?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:52</strong></p>
<p>I'm trying to find a way to describe Rau to you.&nbsp; They have horns and an aposematism.&nbsp; They vary in shapes and sizes also horn coloration and appearance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Judging by your "digital clock" I found a tick is about a minute, maybe a little off?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 20:54</strong></p>
<p>So they look like devils with skin markings?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:56</strong></p>
<p>Some think they are infernal but there is no historical or biological evidence to this.&nbsp; Only past tensions by Helshian and those who came to found Victoria.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>It looks like it's my time to go but I'll be back.&nbsp; Any question you leave here I will answer when I'm back.</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 20:58</strong></p>
<p>Stay safe.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 23:02</strong></p>
<p>I'm back.</p>
<p>Didn't mean to directly message you there Chuck.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Yesterday at 23:04</strong></p>
<p>It's no problem</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 23:12</strong></p>
<p>Looks like some of the existing researchers might be getting involved in your next admissions mission.&nbsp; Mission two is what we call the aptitude examination.&nbsp; For me it was a bunch of questions but for you all it seems as though it will be something different.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Yesterday at 23:13</strong></p>
<p>Any idea what it could be or who the researchers involved might be?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 23:16</strong></p>
<p>Not sure but I have a few guesses.&nbsp; Looking around on the google I confirmed a couple researchers on Project Grindstone and they happen to be from your plane.&nbsp; Strange how easy it was to find on your end.&nbsp; I haven't confirmed a single researcher on our end yet.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Yesterday at 23:17</strong></p>
<p>Any names of the researchers on our end?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 23:19</strong></p>
<p>I also confirmed researched Hyles and researcher Marino at this time.&nbsp; All three are the same situation.Researcher March I was surprised to find was one of you.&nbsp; Although that makes sense as I've never seen her in person.&nbsp; Also I tried to pull up her personnel file and it seems to be missing from files I can access with my clearance.</p>
<p>I suspect there are many more of you.&nbsp; UMAD is a big place so it didn't seem strange to go without seeing certain researchers but now I might look into this closer.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Yesterday at 23:24</strong></p>
<p>Huh, Hyles I already knew about from a Twitter post, that's who I found this out from. Do not know about March and Marino.</p>
<p>We might have to do some snooping to see if they've said anything about Grindstone</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 23:40</strong></p>
<p>Also there is a researcher Freeman that is from your side.&nbsp; I just confirmed.</p>
<h2>29th July 2021</h2>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:12</strong></p>
<p>Alright, the trap has been placed to intercept correspondence by air elemental.&nbsp; Hopefully I grab something within a day.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 00:40</strong></p>
<p>Nice, thanks so much.</p>
<p>Quick thing, you mentioned that you were surprised to find that March is on our end, what made you believe otherwise before?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:04</strong></p>
<p>There is a lot that goes on at UMAD.&nbsp; I've seen her name and knew she was a researcher.&nbsp; What I didn't know is that there were researchers of ours on your plane. There is no clear indication as to who is and is not from where you are on my end.&nbsp; I have determined that each of the employee records for them are missing from files I can access at my clearance level however.</p>
<p>I hope you don't mind but I've been going through the old logs on the general chat.&nbsp; Researcher Hyles referred you Chuck but who referred you TheShades?</p>
<p>Also, if there is any insight I can give on the admissions process I'd be happy to provide it to hedge our chances on getting you into a UMAD department.&nbsp; Speaking of, have either of you considered what departments you'd join?&nbsp; Spreading ourselves out into the various departments might be the most efficient way to gather information.&nbsp; I can provide what I know about each department.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:09</strong></p>
<p>Hyles is the one who referred me as well. In fact, I know Researcher Hyles quite well, since he moonlights as a Singer. He just performed this weekend, as a matter of fact, and I have a recording of said performance.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 02:10</strong></p>
<p>Good idea, best to get an edge on the process so we can make sure we get in. I'm assuming we can only join research departments?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:10</strong></p>
<p>I think Hyles works closely with March.&nbsp; I know they are frequently working together.</p>
<p>You're currently in a researcher applicant pool so unfortunately that is the case.</p>
<p>Who recruited you Butcher?</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 02:13</strong></p>
<p>Ah damn, I would've gone into Administration if I could so that we could get eyes inside where key documents might be going, or maybe Human Resources so we can find out any unethical practices in UMAD</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 02:15</strong></p>
<p>Oh hey peach is back</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:15</strong></p>
<p>They asked you a question, actually</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 02:15</strong></p>
<p>Did they? One sec. Let me get caught up</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:17</strong></p>
<p>As I understand it you were all added to an applicant pool for the field research track.&nbsp; The first mission is for the establishment of applicants.&nbsp; Usually the easiest tests to make certain there is a commitment to the applicant process.&nbsp; The second mission is the aptitude examination which when I did it was a list of questions for you it looks like it'll be a series of smaller tests.&nbsp; The third mission is an examination of physical aptitude.&nbsp; The final is typically an interview.&nbsp; The way you've been tested is unconventional but that does makes sense since you are extra planar entities not too dissimilar from deific extensions, devils, and the like.&nbsp; They must have had to adapt for your situation.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 02:17</strong></p>
<p>If March works frequently with Hyles and she's on this end, she might go by Annapantsu online? She's sung a fair few times with Hyles and she's on this server</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:18</strong></p>
<p>Researcher March's given name is Anna so that would make sense.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:19</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, that's her. I just confirmed through her profile in other locations. Makes me wonder if we know the third one, Marino, now.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:19</strong></p>
<p>I don't think she is singing for UMAD…</p>
<p>I'd think you knew Freeman.&nbsp; She is associated with something called Anime?&nbsp; The word comes up on your discord profile as well.&nbsp; Maybe you two know each other somehow?&nbsp; I haven't looked into "anime" on the google yet.</p>
<p>I just used the google.&nbsp; There is so much anime…</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 02:23</strong></p>
<p>March is who I saw, but she was just responding to Hyle's tweet, so in a roundabout way I guess Hyle?</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 02:24</strong></p>
<p>Anime is a beast of its own on Google, search it at your own risk Peach</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:24</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, anime is kind of my thing too. I'm an Anime Reviewer myself. Wait, is Freeman a Female, by chance?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:24</strong></p>
<p>Yes, she is.</p>
<p>All Humans too.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:26</strong></p>
<p>I think I might know her then. If my hunch is right, her first name is Lizzie or Elizabeth?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:26</strong></p>
<p>Yes, I believe so.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:27</strong></p>
<p>I knew it! She's what's known as a Voice Actor, as she plays some characters in Anime. I've Reviewed a couple of her performances.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:27</strong></p>
<p>I don't know Marino's given name however.</p>
<p>Maybe Culture has something to do with this…</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 02:28</strong></p>
<p>Oh wow Lizzie is involved too? Awesome!</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:28</strong></p>
<p>You seem very familiar with Lizzie, Peach?</p>
<p>Butcher rather.&nbsp; You can tell I'm tired.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:29</strong></p>
<p>She is also a Youtube singer. She covered the OP of one of the Anime she did voice work for: In/Spectre, which I reviewed, and featured her cover on (Though I didn't realize it was her till after I made my video on it)</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:30</strong></p>
<p>I'll have to investigate</p>
<p>I should probably stay away from the employee files for awhile however.&nbsp; I've been there too much recently.</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 02:31</strong></p>
<p>Probably not as well as Shades since he's a reviewer but I've watched some of the anime shes been in</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:33</strong></p>
<p>She's also been in a series called "Jojo's Bizzare Adventures" which is where most have likely heard her voice before. I'd be cautious, though. That anime lives up to that name. It can be wierd, at least by our standards.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 02:34</strong></p>
<p>It took me a while to figure out who she was until I saw that she was in Jojo</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:34</strong></p>
<p>Did she belong to a Company at some point?&nbsp; It's not necessary for travel here anymore but not many people go on "adventures" these days without some protection or wealth.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:36</strong></p>
<p>It's just the name of a story. Freeman simply plays a Character in an anime fiction.</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 02:36</strong></p>
<p>A Company? Im not sure what business shed be contracted to, if any. I know nothing of the VA world.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 02:36</strong></p>
<p>I mean she likely has an agent that finds her acting jobs but in regards to Jojo's she acts out a fictional character's voice which is played over an animation</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 02:37</strong></p>
<p>She's an actor. Or rather, she uses her voice for animated characters.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:37</strong></p>
<p>Not a business company.&nbsp; I understand the misunderstanding.&nbsp; What I mean is a company by claim of local lordship.&nbsp; People who have a free travel visa.</p>
<p>I'm not going to understand this maybe we should move on to questions about departments.&nbsp; I'll research anime in my free time to get a clearer picture of things.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:39</strong></p>
<p>Fair enough, I could go all day on that topic, much like someone else you know. What Departments would we be likely sent to if we're brought on? We need to know what our options are?</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 02:40</strong></p>
<p>Sure. Tell us about the different departments. We know necromancy, and culture exist. And I think you mentioned a planar one too?</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 02:42</strong></p>
<p>If I remember correctly wasn't it Culture, Necromancy, Aetherial Study, Planar, Engineering, Alchemy, Infernal Affairs, Accounting, Administration, and Human Resources that you mentioned?</p>
<p>With the last four being no-goes because they're not research departments</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:43</strong></p>
<p>Necromancy is more appropriately titled a programming department.&nbsp; They work on aetherial structures, constructs we call them.&nbsp; Constructs have aetherial shape that overlays on the material object.&nbsp; It's much easier to craft a construct from a corpse however than hunks of metal.&nbsp; They specialize in the multidimensional code and networks that create the structure of these objects.&nbsp; Their department head does not communicate directly often but is very informative if you reach out to them.&nbsp; They seem to just be shut in their office all day.</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 02:44</strong></p>
<p>So if we reach out to Pauchik he'd be a good source of info. If we can reach out to him that is. Just gotta be okay with the nightmare fuel lol</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:45</strong></p>
<p>Culture is a strange department.&nbsp; They study everything from Richwood theory to history to social enigmas.&nbsp; They hope to better understand the foundations of culture and what makes a person themselves.&nbsp; Many of them are taught deceptive tactics so that they can produce "cleaner" data from their experiments.&nbsp; When the project is declared necessary for national security they usually do not even tell their subjects of their role.&nbsp; This makes them suspicious to me in just about everything they do.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 02:46</strong></p>
<p>Not a bad idea, at least one of us should probably head there then. I can only imagine the office politics though with everyone shut in with corpses to keep themselves busy</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 02:46</strong></p>

<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:47</strong></p>
<p>Ok, I was eyeing Culture, but sounds like it's not as simple as I thought. I'm not exactly the best of decievers. I'm too honest for my own good.</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 02:48</strong></p>
<p>Oh cultural just screams umbrella corp. Bet you any applicants that go there are just guinea pigs themselves</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 02:48</strong></p>
<p>I'm bad at lying but I can keep my mouth shut quite well when needed. Only problem is that since we're extraplanar we're bound to turn a lot of heads once someone's there.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:48</strong></p>
<p>Seems like what we consider a Spy Agency, in my opinion</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:49</strong></p>
<p>Engineering and Alchemy were once the same department and the Religious studies department was consumed by culture for the sake of secularity in study.&nbsp; Engineering lacks a department head and no one seems like they are in a rush to fill the position.&nbsp; Engineering operates on much of what you suspect and they are often involved in government projects especially military projects.&nbsp; They have a strange man there named Meer Soot who is very temperamental.&nbsp; It's believed his actions have led to the death of his last two assistants yet he still operates with a wealth of funding for his projects.&nbsp; Projects of nonsense that fit closer into aetherial research than anything.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 02:50</strong></p>
<p>If we happen to get a few more people here that we can trust we could probably assign at least one person for each department, ideally</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 02:51</strong></p>
<p>I think thats a good bare minimum, chuck.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:51</strong></p>
<p>It would be ideal to assign someone to each department.&nbsp; That would give us the largest spread of information.&nbsp; Speaking of extra planar...&nbsp; As I said before the Planar department does not keep their department head for long.&nbsp; They deal with some of the most dangerous field work as every plane you cross to provides a chance at being plane touched.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 02:52</strong></p>
<p>Plane touched? As in you get warped by that plane?</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 02:53</strong></p>
<p>So engineering sounds like Meer Soot calls the shots unofficially and is the mad scientist type?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:54</strong></p>
<p>Alchemy has a very informative and prompt head.&nbsp; He is a stickler for deadlines however and plays favorites often with his research funding practices.&nbsp; Not much to really say about them other than hold your breath when you can on that floor and if it looks volatile then it probably is.&nbsp; If it doesn't then it still probably is.</p>
<p>Meer Soot doesn't call any shots but I would definitely call the man mad.&nbsp; Plane Touched individuals are those whose perception has permanently warped due to the sudden need to acclimate to the new Belthidian Laws of the region in five dimensional space. You could simply lose your concept of time or you could lose consciousness entirely.&nbsp; It's still a mystery how it affects the sentient.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 02:56</strong></p>
<p>I was thinking of maybe trying Alchemy, in this plane I am actually studying for a degree in Chemistry so I might have a small head start in it</p>
<p>Assuming your plane has physical rules even slightly similar to ours</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 02:58</strong></p>
<p>Belthidian Laws? Im assuming thats something scientific like what we call physics?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 03:03</strong></p>
<p>Physics?&nbsp; That sounds a little closed in concept and takes the divine out of consideration.&nbsp; How can such a narrow sighted approach be practical.&nbsp; Much like chemistry, that takes out the spiritual concepts and simplifies the world to current attracting cubes and dodecahedrons together.&nbsp; Now the wheel is a much more reasonable explanation for the interactions of different material.&nbsp; I suppose I have to accept that your world must have some different Toristic concepts that are practical...&nbsp; Afterall, I've never seen the technology in these anime you show me.&nbsp; That is fiction however so maybe I'm getting ahead of myself.</p>
<p>Maybe I'm being too critical, my apologies.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 03:05</strong></p>
<p>No worries. We're an admittedly more Primative species here. We don't have access to stuff like Divination or Planar like you've described. Most of our technology is all pretty basic by comparison</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 03:05</strong></p>
<p>No need to apologise, it seems we all have a lot we can learn from each other</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 03:06</strong></p>
<p>Pretty much. It might explain why UMAD is looking at our world right now</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 03:07</strong></p>
<p>Very different worlds with very different rules it seems</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 03:10</strong></p>
<p>Oh!&nbsp; Aetherial study.&nbsp; They study aetherial effects from all stages.&nbsp; They make the magic happen, pun intended.&nbsp; They research Summation, Aeonization, and magical programming.&nbsp; If you want to learn aetherial theory they are the guys.&nbsp; Though many times you leave work glowing just a little bit.</p>
<p>What you suggest Shades make me think of the planar department's involvement.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 03:11</strong></p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>Well, I think Aetherial Study might be more up my alley.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 03:12</strong></p>
<p>Six departments so it looks like you're three short if we want to spread across all departments.</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 03:12</strong></p>
<p>I mean the planar dept being the ones to find this plane would make sense given their focus?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 03:13</strong></p>
<p>We're already looking at someone else to join us, but we had a few other names we're considering, so we'll see who we can bring in</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 03:14</strong></p>
<p>Yea we wanted to be slow with this. Not bring too much attention too fast</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 03:14</strong></p>
<p>That's smart.&nbsp; If it gets out as to what I'm doing you might be on your own.</p>
<p>I'm certain necromancy is already looking through the email to find a connection to me.&nbsp; It's only a matter of time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you're in a department the real investigation can begin.&nbsp; Until then I might have occasional work for you.&nbsp; Once there though you'll need to gain trust, maybe work towards a promotion or two.&nbsp; Be careful though because you're on the field research track, they might even recruit you for project grindstone.&nbsp; It's all been so hush hush here though.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 03:35</strong></p>
<p>Oh Peach if you're still here, or just whenever you get back, I wanted to ask what you knew about Researcher Marino? Just so that we can round off who all the researchers might be on our end</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 03:54</strong></p>
<p>Researcher Marino?&nbsp; Not a whole lot.&nbsp; She is a fast talker but I've never seen her.&nbsp; I hear she is also human though.</p>
<p>Looks like another reached out to me.&nbsp; they haven't responded to me yet though.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 03:59</strong></p>
<p>Hmmmmm so a fast talker and likely human. Anything else in particular? Like what she does or how she might have worked with Hyles or March or Freeman?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 04:00</strong></p>
<p>I've been in contact with another who might be willing to help. I didn't give them the way in, so we can be sure they're ready to help. Only gave them a clue on how to understand you</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:00</strong></p>
<p>I don't think she has worked with any of them... I also don't know what the researchers do in your plane.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 04:03</strong></p>
<p>I could dig around a bit to see if she's mentioned Grindstone at all, that tends to be what's lead people to this server.</p>
<p>Also the researchers in our plane are mostly performers</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:04</strong></p>
<p>Those are clues at least.</p>
<p>I know there has been increased contact with the Wizard's Whimsy in town and they have a local theater attached to it like a barnacle.&nbsp; I might take a break from the employee records and poke around there tomorrow to see if there is anything I can find.</p>
<p>This Brandon fellow doesn't seem to be saying much.&nbsp; Maybe the interference is the problem.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 04:10</strong></p>
<p>He's probably just trying to take a crack at deciphering how your messages appear on our end. TheShades gave him a cryptic but pretty helpful clue</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:10</strong></p>
<p>Smart, we need trustworthy but also capable individuals to help here.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 04:11</strong></p>
<p>Exactly. We had to figure out how to decode your posts, so if Brandon plans to help us, he should know how to do the same. I'm helping as much as I can, but I won't give it away</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 04:11</strong></p>
<p>Exactly. We had to figure out how to decode your posts, so if Brandon plans to help us, he should know how to do the same. I'm helping as much as I can, but I won't give it away</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:12</strong></p>
<p>I'm sorry I can't be of more help with Marino.&nbsp; If any names come to mind you want me to search on my end then I can do that.</p>
<p>The connection I take differs some days.&nbsp; I worry that I might not be understood on those days.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 04:15</strong></p>
<p>We understand you fine. We've learned how to decode your transmissions pretty efficiently.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 04:16</strong></p>
<p>We've worked out how to decipher your messages quite easily, it's no bother.</p>
<p>If transmission ends up weird then it's fine, we just try something new. I actually managed to unscramble your interfered message earlier, I don't know if you're just giving us license to hack into UMAD but I guess if we can't technically get caught then it might not be a bad last resort</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:19</strong></p>
<p>Let's just not get ahead of ourselves.&nbsp; I'm not sure what you mean by hacking or if it's even really safe.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 04:20</strong></p>
<p>Oh it most definitely isn't safe, we probably wouldn't even be able to do it though since it's all extraplanar</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 04:20</strong></p>
<p>Hacking is when we use programming to access a system we shouldn't have access to. We're not ready to do that yet, but if need be, we'll consider doing so to learn more about UMAD's plans</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:24</strong></p>
<p>You're a programmer?&nbsp; How far in your study are you?&nbsp; Are you making aetherial structures yet or are you more the practical caster?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 04:27</strong></p>
<p>It's not quite the same. We use simple typed code on our more basic systems. However, if they are connecting to our systems, we might be able to reverse that, and connect theirs using our own tech. In any kind of system, there's often a backdoor that can be accessed. And with this kind of crossing of technology, there's bound to be something we can access our way</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:28</strong></p>
<p>Interesting...</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 04:28</strong></p>
<p>Oh our programming is a lot more different to yours it seems, I'm not exactly well-versed in it but I do know how to make the words "Hello World" appear on a screen. It's mostly done by sitting at a computer and entering commands to make it do certain things, a bit like using a mechanical construct I'd imagine</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:29</strong></p>
<p>Advanced programming techniques are the specialty of necromancy but the theory is strongest in aetherial studies.&nbsp; Maybe information can be found there.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 04:31</strong></p>
<p>I get the Feeling we'll have to show him how our tech works, so that he can understand better how it's weird to us that their more magic based tech can even interact with ours. Based on what you've taught us, it shouldn't even be possible for you to talk with us like this. Yet, here we are. So how is this possible? Once we understand that, we might have a grasp on what we can do with it.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:32</strong></p>
<p>Maybe it's planar overlay...</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 04:32</strong></p>
<p>That might be a good idea, if you have a better understanding of how our methods of communication work then we might get to understand how you interact with it and how you communicate as well</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:33</strong></p>
<p>We could certainly give it a try?</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 04:35</strong></p>
<p>Ok so the way that we communicate with each other over long distances using the internet is typically with a device called a computer, and they look like this</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:431px;"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/OrDTHZWWfjtRL3eCPmYAHxJhgd0qI2vlIVAV0I6Noiez72EjrwV4dU-hz_kdshL-jTA8iWBHlP3xK7MsgazKksweuL5TfqSUhBY8FJx9t8Dvgm7F88D-UZhKMOUbettbL36FuaNJ"></figure>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 04:35</strong></p>
<p>Let me see how I can explain this.</p>
<p>Unlike your use of Corpses and Necromancy, our Communication Technology uses simple mixes of Metals, Silicon and Electricity to send signals from one point to another. Even our Visual Monitors use a Liquid Crystal, like Quartz, to convert those signals to a visual form.</p>
<p>We use a Plastic Keyboard to input our commands and text.</p>
<p>Since you have access to our Google Search Engine, you can easily research "Computer" and find out more specific details about how it works.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:37</strong></p>
<p>Plastic?&nbsp; Is that a mirror on the device?</p>
<p>I'll look into computer more.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 04:38</strong></p>
<p>Plastic is a man-Made material using Petroleum Oil compressed into pellets, that are then melted and molded into different objects. Again, Google can tell you more.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:39</strong></p>
<p>I...see...</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 04:39</strong></p>
<p>I'd also recommend researching the history of the internet so that you can get a better idea of how we communicate with each other through our computers</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 04:40</strong></p>
<p>I feel like we are going to frequently get side tracked trying to explain each other's worlds.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:40</strong></p>
<p>Computers seem to transmit messages in a similar way to our air elementals.&nbsp; I will say, this is the fastest way I've ever seen to communicate even if there are some problems with it.</p>
<p>Well, I live here so if you have questions about my world I can try my best to explain.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 04:42</strong></p>
<p>I know, it's vastly different from what you use in your world. Like i've said, magic and the Divine doesn't exist in our world. The only divine thing we have is religion, and even that isn't all too consistent, with groups withing groups of different beliefs.</p>
<p>I will warn, our Internet has a lot of misinformation being posted by people with their own agendas. If you want the best starting point, lookup "WikiPedia" it's a digital encyclopedia that is edited by users, but is often a reliable source for the kind of information you'd seek</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 04:44</strong></p>
<p>Oh peach, i just had a thought. You work in umad right? Atleast as a cover. What department are you assigned to?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:46</strong></p>
<p>There are only ten characters used in the script of the encyclopedia?&nbsp; I'll have to learn the script.&nbsp; Religion is very confusing here as well.&nbsp; So many denominations and with the frequent consul I'm surprised anyone knows what any domain really means.&nbsp; Also all the arguing of which god owns what domain...&nbsp; Then there are questionable agendas with some of the clergy I find.&nbsp; Ultimately however direct guidance is a difficult thing to provide people so I suppose it makes a lot of sense.&nbsp; It is a matter of faith after all.</p>
<p>I don't work here as a cover.&nbsp; I came here to be a researcher.&nbsp; As for my department...&nbsp; For my security that might be best to be kept to myself for now.</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 04:48</strong></p>
<p>A matter of faith is a good way to put it here too.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:48</strong></p>
<p>I think Doublelock worshippers have it right.&nbsp; No organized faith at all.&nbsp; At the same time it can be a little confusing but then again no one can know what Doublelock wants.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 04:49</strong></p>
<p>Wait... DoubleLock? That was the First Password we deciphered. Tell us more about them</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 04:49</strong></p>
<p>Wait wait wait, Doublelock? What kind of domain does Doublelock have?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:49</strong></p>
<p>I'm not a religious scholar as you can see so I am speaking of ignorance and do apologize.</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 04:49</strong></p>
<p>So wait you want to expose umad but youre a researcher by choice? Doesnt that seem contradictory?</p>
<p>Oh snap yes. More on Doublelock if you would.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:53</strong></p>
<p>Doublelock? They are the god fate, absolute concepts, and intellectual immortality.&nbsp; In the beginning they left time to be seated in the center of all things.&nbsp; There is no interaction with them at all, they just are.&nbsp; They wait outside of time for the end to occur where he also is.&nbsp; No one is certain of how to clearly find their perpetuity after judgement so those who worship them simply attempt to find intellectual immortality and be remembered forever.&nbsp; The consequence of this is always great but not always beneficial to others.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 04:56</strong></p>
<p>Intellectual immortality? Usually for our plane that means being accredited towards making some kind of scientific advancements, which sometimes isn't beneficial to other people. How do people try attain intellectual immortality?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 04:56</strong></p>
<p>Doesn't sound all that much different than some of the Religions practiced in our world. Worshiping an Immortal Being, seeking to be remembered forever. We know plenty here who would fit perfectly in DoubleLock</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:56</strong></p>
<p>I came here to be a researcher but found myself growing in concern with recent developments.&nbsp; UMAD intends to protect us but I question their actions sometimes.&nbsp; They are practical, always, but rarely consider a non value based approach to things.&nbsp; Accounting is responsible for defining the value of most things.</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 04:56</strong></p>
<p>The god of fate stuck at the end of time? I can see why followers would want to be remembered forever then</p>
<p>So you support their goal but not their methods?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 04:58</strong></p>
<p>So basically, they are Strictly Logic-Based. They have no ethics or empathy, even though their cause is a good one. Yeah, we have a saying for that based on one of our Religions: "The Road to Hell is Paved with Good Intentions"</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:58</strong></p>
<p>In death you will be judged by Qoseem and find yourself closest with the domains you perpetuate.&nbsp; If you did not commit yourself to service of the god in alignment with your service you find yourself in the realm on Ananakaeia.&nbsp; For those who do not commit to worship however they see a much worse fate...</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 04:59</strong></p>
<p>Can we ask what kind of fate?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:59</strong></p>
<p>Value based ethics are their bread and butter.&nbsp; Simple good, destructive of good, and not applicable in value considered.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 05:02</strong></p>
<p>So a classic utilitarian kind of mindset? "Humankind is governed by two sovereign masters: pleasure and pain?"</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 05:02</strong></p>
<p>They say Doublelock wrote all things.&nbsp; This however was pointless as there was a spread of uncertain phenomena when The Scoundrel bestowed part of themself to all that would be sentient giving us free will.&nbsp; Doublelock became god whose purpose in creation was moot.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 05:04</strong></p>
<p>Wow, this sounds eerily like one of our most prominent religions on earth. A God that governs all, a being that sacrificed themselves to give us choice. We have something like that ourselves, albeit slightly different. Just goes to show how similar we can be</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 05:07</strong></p>
<p>Not as such.&nbsp; Language is a set of domains with expressed values.&nbsp; Take for instance the word cup, there are values that create cup which in of themselves are sets of values.&nbsp; We call this the definition or the domain where the sets that occupy the definition to be the sub-domains of cup.&nbsp; The good is that which achieves the definition of the object.&nbsp; A god is perfectly and most beautifully it's domains.&nbsp; Beauty being that which is strictly its domains and nothing more where perfection is being complete in the domain.&nbsp; For instance if a set was the values 1, 4, and 9 then the values to the set 1, 4, 9, and 11 would be perfect but not beautiful.&nbsp; UMAD exists as an entity dedicated to a singular good, the good of the our plane and its protection.</p>
<p>A good is simply that which promotes the domain.&nbsp; That which destroys a goods is malicious.&nbsp; UMAD exist as a beneficent entity but with a singular goal.&nbsp; This by perspective can often been seen as malicious however.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 05:11</strong></p>
<p>My thought's exactly. They don't see other potentials, laser focused on the one, when others might be more beneficial. One has to be open to all possibilities. It's something us Humans struggle with every day.</p>
<p>Didn't think we'd be debating philosophy in here today.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 05:12</strong></p>
<p>sometimes it's necessary.&nbsp; See wartime, the death of a person is a loss of good but in death they might promote another ideology.&nbsp; This is true of most actions.&nbsp; UMAD just has the power to do...a lot.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 05:15</strong></p>
<p>We know this all to well. The Sacrifice of life for the promotion of our ideals. The Country I reside in pretty much lives by that mindset, to a fault admittedly. And those with power often determine what those Ideals are, or worse: how they should be realized. No one person or group should have that much power.</p>
<p>Another old saying of ours: "Power Corrupts, and Absolute Power Corrupts Absolutely". We've seen all to well how true that is</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 05:15</strong></p>
<p>I step away and we are discussing philosophy? Never a dull moment for the PITS team lol</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 05:16</strong></p>
<p>PITS is the name we made for us: the Peach Investigation and Tactics Squad.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 05:16</strong></p>
<p>Rameus would agree with you.&nbsp; That's why our government powers were divided when he came into power.&nbsp; I just think he did too little for his seat and too much for UMAD…</p>
<p>That's a very fun name!&nbsp; I love it!</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 05:17</strong></p>
<p>Awwwwwww I'm glad you like it</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 05:18</strong></p>
<p>Rameus seemed like a good man. Sadly, those who are filled with greed can easily manipulate good men to get what they want.</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 05:18</strong></p>
<p>Is, or was, Rameus your leader then?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 05:19</strong></p>
<p>Royalists would disagree with you.&nbsp; My country has changed so drastically over the last few years.&nbsp; We are trying to relearn how to live and are trying to rebuild from the revolution.</p>
<p>Rameus is our current King.&nbsp; If you can call him a King?&nbsp; It's uncertain.&nbsp; He certainly looks like one but not like any we had before.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 05:22</strong></p>
<p>My country had something similar to that at one point, he called himself The Lord Protector. Essentially all he did was stamp out a lot of royalist sentiment and imposed a lot of religious restrictions on things people used to enjoy, as he deemed them "sinful".</p>
<p>What kinds of things has Rameus done?</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 05:23</strong></p>
<p>Im going to be heading out, fyi, but i look forward to catching up tomorrow</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 05:24</strong></p>
<p>Oh yeah no worries, I definitely need to be heading out too soon</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 05:28</strong></p>
<p>Rameus eliminated the flesh trade and created a system of free education for those who could safely travel to the institution but they only accept the young to begin molding them or older people who pass examinations.&nbsp; He ended the restriction on aetherial education allowing people to learn to become casters.&nbsp; Eliminated the noble class and enacted land reform from the old royalists territories and even those lords who sided with him.&nbsp; He then ended the people's tax allowing people to choose their own profession and permitting free travel.&nbsp; Without direction and people being taxed to the capital city artisans decreased in supply while demand became an all time high.&nbsp; Now there are more Albertians in the highways than ever and people are hungry and don't know how to lead their lives.</p>
<p>He also divided powers within the government but you already know this.</p>
<p>I can confirm there will be an incoming batch of air elementals soon.&nbsp; I'll let you know what I collect.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 05:31</strong></p>
<p>So before Rameus everyone was given a set purpose? I'm going to guess that the purpose you're given aligns with the service of a god like you mentioned earlier?</p>
<p>Ah very good, I'm looking forward to it. I definitely have to get some sleep first but I've still got a few questions in me if that's alright</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 05:35</strong></p>
<p>Back when people were tied to the land the old king Othello would tax baronies a supply of people to be taken to the capital city.&nbsp; From there they would learn a trade and some would remain while others would be sent to other baronies as rewards or out of need.&nbsp; Duke Graves was a favorite of Othello and often took artisans.&nbsp; Few people were taught aetherial casting.&nbsp; The only real escape was to join the Order of the Magus or become a member of the clergy.</p>
<p>Ask away!&nbsp; I'll answer what I can.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 05:39</strong></p>
<p>Ok just a few</p>
<p>1. What was the flesh trade? Those words sound very strange and slightly horrifying to our ears</p>
<p>2. Who were the Albertians?&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. What's the difference between the Order of the Magus and UMAD? Is UMAD a branch of the Order of the Magus?</p>
<p>And then my last question is a hunch that I have regarding who Marino might be</p>
<p>Specifically I think Marino might go by Cami-Cat on our end, it's a bit of a long shot though as she has collaborated with Hyles before and you mentioned you don't think Marino has worked with him</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 05:43</strong></p>
<p>I'll try to answer each of these.&nbsp; The flesh trade is the trade of slaves or components of chill. Albertians worship the god of highway men and grave robbing.&nbsp; They themselves are often are highway men, an unlawful profession that has become very necessary given the state of our nation.&nbsp; The Order of the Magus is certainly not related to UMAD.&nbsp; They are an old order established during the time of the Azalt to act as educators but restricted their teachings to behind closed doors.&nbsp; They were apolitical until very recently.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't know of any researcher named Cami-Cat but she sounds familiar…</p>
<p>Hold on…</p>
<p>I've seen her name before.&nbsp; She was mentioned very briefly.&nbsp; She is not a researcher but she is mentioned by another researcher.&nbsp; I'm looking quickly.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 05:49</strong></p>
<p>Ok that's good, take your time, no pressure</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 05:49</strong></p>
<p>Yes!&nbsp; It's a report by a member of engineering.&nbsp; Their name has been redacted however…</p>
<p>They called her researcher but in the report clarify that she was not a researcher at UMAD...&nbsp; I suppose they worked together elsewhere?</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 05:52</strong></p>
<p>Perhaps perhaps. What was the report on?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 05:54</strong></p>
<p>It was a field work assignment between engineering and the planar department.&nbsp; It's mostly redacted...&nbsp; I'd send a message like I did last time with the UMAD administrative email but it would be too dangerous.&nbsp; Maybe if I can gain access to other systems with a higher clearance I could find a safer way to send this.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before you go Chuck.&nbsp; Can we all agree to keep what I've talked about here between us?&nbsp; I'm not sure if I'm risking our national security talking about this and if UMAD thought I was more of a threat then I would likely disappear much faster.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 05:57</strong></p>
<p>I don't think we have any reason to blab. Unless we felt you were the bigger threat, which I don't see that being the case right now, we need you here to uncover the truth. Our lips are sealed.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 05:58</strong></p>
<p>Oh of course. You seem to know more of the inner workings of UMAD and you haven't been threatening to us, we have no real reason to do so.</p>
<p>I think best to wait until we've gotten our way up the ranks of the departments so that we can crack open more of the higher clearance stuff</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 06:02</strong></p>
<p>I hope the redacted information was still at all helpful.&nbsp; The only other note I can make about the report is it was made in orange ink.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 06:04</strong></p>
<p>Huh, well that's very strange, I'll keep that in mind</p>
<p>It's still quite interesting, even if it didn't lead to Marino</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 06:06</strong></p>
<p>Finding either of these researchers might help the investigation on my side.&nbsp; Just let me know what you find.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 06:09</strong></p>
<p>Sure, if I end up finding anything I'll post it here. Thanks for the help and the history, it's quite interesting hearing about your world and I hope I can return the favour. I'm probably going to head out now, I'm looking forward to taking a crack at the intercepted messages soon. I'll see y'all soon then!</p>
<p><mark class="pen-red"><strong><u>[Peach’s messages appear in reverse Base 64]</u></strong></mark></p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 19:54</strong></p>
<p>Caught something but it'll be a bit before I can send you something that can be worked with.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 20:02</strong></p>
<p>Ok, first thing, your message has been encrypted differently from when you were last speaking, I'm going to assume this is a consequence of you catching something.</p>
<p>Good news is I managed to figure it out, so it's all fine.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:09</strong></p>
<p>That's good.&nbsp; I did connect with you at a new access point I made so maybe that's it?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:11</strong></p>
<p>That explains it. Still, we're able to keep up. So you have some Air Elementals for us to work with, you said?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:14</strong></p>
<p>Not precisely.&nbsp; A not very well known and honestly difficult method of communication is by causing a air elemental to reverberate in a series of transverse waves within their structure.&nbsp; The aetherial net I cast allows the message to be copied as the elemental passes through but it doesn't always hit the net evenly and produces something we call rotational interference.&nbsp; I'm currently picking apart the rotational interference and then translating the sound into proper code.&nbsp; It might take me a bit to get the ciphered message for you to look at.</p>
<p>Any news on new recruits?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:17</strong></p>
<p>Brandon is still struggling with deciphering your transmissions, so I gave him a re-worded clue.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 20:18</strong></p>
<p>Brandon has reached out to you obviously</p>
<p>I tried to get someone who's been fairly active on the server in regards to the cipher, but she hasn't responded to me yet</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:19</strong></p>
<p>That's disappointing.&nbsp; I did get news that Researcher March is meeting with the head of Culture today but the means were uncertain.</p>
<p>Also the content of the meeting I could not find.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:23</strong></p>
<p>And I assume trying to talk to them ourselves would not be advised. I'm already working to meet with Mr. Hyles for his other work, but I guess mentioning our chats would not end well.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:24</strong></p>
<p>I was able to get a quick glance of Janet's ledger.&nbsp; Seems Researcher March also met with Infenal Affairs last week.&nbsp; I also looked into The Whimsy today.&nbsp; The theater has been more active recently.&nbsp; Got word from the staff that a "SC" has become a regular there.&nbsp; That place doesn't get regulars because the service is terrible and honestly the troupe's performance still haunts me.&nbsp; This "SC" has apparently been meeting with both the troupe and UMAD officials.</p>
<p>I must strongly advise not discussing this with him as it might be too dangerous.&nbsp; We do not want either of you suspected and be dropped from the applicant pool.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:26</strong></p>
<p>SC, huh? Seems we have someone else to learn about, and what their involvement is.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:27</strong></p>
<p>Will your meeting be private or will it be accesible on the google in any way?However there might be something we can do with that opprotunity.&nbsp; I'll have to do some digging and think on it.&nbsp; When do you plan on meeting with Researcher Hyles?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:29</strong></p>
<p>I'm in discussion with him via E-Mail, and if he agrees, it'll be on August 24th. We'll be broadcasting a Concert he performed this last weekend, and I'll be in an Voice Chat here, so It'll be on Google's Video Service, Youtube.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:32</strong></p>
<p>I suspect you'll almost be free of the admissions process by then.&nbsp; Maybe you'll be assigned to a department by then?&nbsp; Who knows, they are taking this process very slowly for you and your applicants.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:36</strong></p>
<p>They've been taking their time since you snuck in there with that one E-Mail, so they might be trying to lock down their system to make sure you can't pull that again. Might need to change tactics if you plan to reach out again.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:39</strong></p>
<p>The current tactics of reaching out is hopefully through you all.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:40</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, makes Sense. harder to trace back to you if we're the ones going out there.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:40</strong></p>
<p>I don't suspect they will drag their feet for long however.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:45</strong></p>
<p>Ok, just making sure. I'll begin contacting someone else to see if they will join us</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:46</strong></p>
<p>I might leave soon.&nbsp; I want to see if there is anyway to evesdrop on the meeting safely.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:47</strong></p>
<p>Be Careful. We'll work on what we can here in the meantime</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 21:29</strong></p>
<p>I have a few things I can confirm.&nbsp; Researcher March will be getting involved with your application process by instruction of Janet and the Culture Department.&nbsp; She will also be running another recruitment drive soon.&nbsp; It seems whatever they are doing they need more people for it.&nbsp; I believe she is involved in the aptitude examination as well as the final mission for the application process.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 21:36</strong></p>
<p>So she's not someone we should reveal anything to. But at least we know to be ready for her to appear soon</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Yesterday at 23:22</strong></p>
<p>So we noticed a user named "alyssamarino" just joined the server. Would that be our other person of interest?</p>
<h2>30th July 2021</h2>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:24</strong></p>
<p>Possibly, I have no given name for researcher Marino.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 00:28</strong></p>
<p>Looking into things similar to the user I found an Alyssa Marino who uses the same profile picture and is a wrestling commentator and professional cereal eater apparently. I'm guessing her commentating is what might have been meant when you said she's a fast talker?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:29</strong></p>
<p>What I meant is she talks fast.</p>
<p>Another person messaged me but they don't seem to be responding to me.&nbsp; Possibly communication difficulties?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 00:31</strong></p>
<p>What we mean is that she is a Commentator, which is where someone talks about what is happening in an event. I assume you've had something like an Arena in your world?</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 00:33</strong></p>
<p>I'm guessing that's Snow, I've pointed her in your direction. I've given her a bit of a cryptic clue along the lines that TheShades did.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:35</strong></p>
<p>The arena in the capital sure.&nbsp; There is also undergound arena fighting.&nbsp; As long as you don't claim it's an honor duel you might not be claimed a felon.</p>
<p>Yes, so she is a referral.&nbsp; I'll keep an eye out.&nbsp; Hopefully either Snow or Brandon find a way to respond to me…</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 00:38</strong></p>
<p>We stopped doing those kind of arenas ages ago. But we do have many Sports that are friendly competetions. We have two forms of Wrestling, where people grapple each other to the ground. Actual wrestling is a major sport, but we also have what is called "Professional Wrestling" Where it's more of a Stage Show, but with people fake fighting (Though they are still very physical), just with stories and characters (Another thing to add to the Goggle Search List). If this is the same Marino that joined the server, she commentates in "Professional" Wrestling, where she calls out the moves they do so the audience can follow along</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:40</strong></p>
<p>Why would you have fake fighting?&nbsp; What do you mean "call out moves"?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 00:45</strong></p>
<p>It's for Entertainment purposes. They still hurt themselves to some extent, but it's all planned and controlled for the most enjoyment and least actual harm. When I say "Call Out Moves", I mean they explain what moves are being performed, so as to get the viewers excited about what is happening as they watch.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:46</strong></p>
<p>Speaking of entertainment purposes you speak with entertainers TheShades?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 00:48</strong></p>
<p>Mostly in Anime, but I have done Interviews, where I sit down and ask questions to the Actors. I've also worked with others like myself who make content for the Internet, like Researcher Hyles. I'm not exactly very popular in that regard, since few have seen what I've made, but i've gotten to work with many other entertainers of different types thanks to what I do.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:50</strong></p>
<p>You were suggesting approaching Researcher Hyles.&nbsp; What did you have in mind?&nbsp; Would it be at this event you had planned?</p>

<p>He recently performed a Concert at what we call a Convention, where people of similar interests gather to have fun and meet entertainers from that topic, in my case Anime. I recorded that concert, and will be re-broadcasting it online, and I'm looking to have him join me to talk about it, asking why he chose the songs he performed, and how it felt being on stage at the event.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:55</strong></p>
<p>I'm familar with concerts and with conventions.&nbsp; They might differ in my world however but I'll use the google to look into them more.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 00:58</strong></p>
<p>Fair enough. With how different our worlds have been so far, I'm never if you have stuff similar to our world or not. Better to cover my bases to be safe.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 01:12</strong></p>
<p>Ok, looks like Brandon has figured out how to decode the transmissions. He should be responding to it finally</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:19</strong></p>
<p>My connection has changed since I last spoke with him.&nbsp; Hopefully he will understand me.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 01:21</strong></p>
<p>I've already warned him. Now he knows what to look out for at this point, so it shouldn't be an issue</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:52</strong></p>
<p>He seems to have gone quiet again.</p>
<p>Maybe he doesn't understand the change in communication.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:14</strong></p>
<p>Not quite the convention I know but good perspective.</p>
<p>Is con a typical suffix for these events?</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 02:19</strong></p>
<p>Yeah generally entertainment conventions are shortened to cons here.</p>
<p>What kinds of conventions are you used to?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:23</strong></p>
<p>The conventions I'm used to usually involve a number of people stuffed into small chambers to discuss policy and forget the poor exist.</p>
<p>I have seen a list somewhere ehn looking through files and nearly every word had that suffix...&nbsp; I cannot remember where though.</p>
<p>I took it for Culture's attempt at a new command speak.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 02:27</strong></p>
<p>What do you mean by command speak? Do you remember what the report was about?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:30</strong></p>
<p>A short speak used during confrontation.</p>
<p>It was just a list as far as I could tell.&nbsp; It's been about a season since I've seen it.</p>
<h2>2nd August 2021</h2>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 17:54</strong></p>
<p>I'm adding Brandon and Snow to our char.&nbsp; That makes 5 now.</p>
<p>Also, how is everyone today?&nbsp; I hope safe.&nbsp; It's been a few day.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 17:56</strong></p>
<p>We're doing good. Glad to see they worked out. We'll get them caught up on what we've learned so far, so they can be ready to jump right in</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:04</strong></p>
<p>Did some more digging at the Whimsy in town.&nbsp; Tuns out "SC" only comes around right before the Blue Banner performs there.&nbsp; Also Necromancy is functioning at a higher security level now.&nbsp; When I checked in today at the front desk I also noticed Janet had smudges of orange ink on her thumb and first finger.&nbsp; The only other time I saw orange ink used here was on that document I previously mentioned.&nbsp; I'm sure I could find something in her outbox but she is always at her desk, ALWAYS.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 18:13</strong></p>
<p>It's good to hear back from you Peach. I'm doing alright, glad to hear the others have gotten in</p>
<p>We were discussing the mysterious "SC" earlier actually. What's the Blue Banner? And any particular gossip about the Necromancy department that would give them a higher security level?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:17</strong></p>
<p>Oh?&nbsp; What were you discussing about SC?&nbsp; Blue Banner Theatre is a group that performs mostly at the Wizard's Whimsy a local eatery that never seems to have food.&nbsp; At least they do but the chef seems mad and you might be waiting ages for anything.&nbsp; They generate most of their revenue by other business prospects.&nbsp; The Theatre group is run by Eruc who must be the most talentedly terrible playwright I have ever seen.&nbsp; Never have I known more offensive, distracting, and disgusting performances than very well all of his.&nbsp; I'd assume that Necromancy is under high alert because of what I did last week.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 18:28</strong></p>
<p>We were trying to look for anyone in the server with "SC" as initials. I did a bit of a trawl through the twitters of researchers Hyles and March but couldn't find anything, which leads me to believe that SC might just be entirely on your end. I'm guessing either the Blue Banner is some kind of shock value show or a money laundering scheme going off on that. Anything related to the researchers on our end that might've been going on at the Wizard's Whimsy? You did mention that in relation to us saying that the researchers on our end are entertainers</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 18:46</strong></p>
<p>Thank you everyone for having me. It seems really dangerous to try to get to the documents while it's still at Janet's desk. Unless you have some way of having the Assistant Director get Janet away for a minute so you can get a sneak peak.</p>
<p>Since that seems to be only person she listens to.</p>
<p>Also, The Wizard's Whimsy sounds like a terrible place that's perfect for scoundrels of all kinds to linger around.</p>
<p>Oh, and I don't know if the others mentioned, but I do volunteer myself to go into the Necromancy department.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 19:07</strong></p>
<p>The Whimzy is the closest place to grab food, albiet sometimes, and have a show, albiet terible, to UMAD.&nbsp; A goblin lives there, the only legal goblin I know of.&nbsp; Culture claims he is a social experiment back during the founding of the academy and exists as UMAD property giving him safety to continue his existance within the city.&nbsp; Clever creature he attempts to claim any property ownership by using a surrigate.&nbsp; I'm not certain how a goblin ammassed any money however really let alone has been keeping failing businesses alive.&nbsp; Anyone in town you suggest he is cleaning money to might readily agree but it's uncertain if that would be out of general hate for him.</p>
<p>The church of the scoundrel might be a fair recruitment office for that theatre.&nbsp; The common patron are just those traveling who don't know better though or those people who think they might luck into getting a meal that day.&nbsp; Do you mean the Assistant Headmaster?&nbsp; I'd say anyone listens to him really.&nbsp; So Necromancy and Aetherial Studies are of interest to you all so far?</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 19:10</strong></p>
<p>Well no one's there for the food or entertainment, so the money has to be coming from somewhere. Is the goblins name Culture? He has to be clever if he's the only legal goblin. Judging by the shady dealings, he may have some dirt on someone and is using it to gain citizenship and such.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 19:11</strong></p>
<p>By Culture I mean the Culture department.&nbsp; I'm not sure his name but it shouldn't be hard to find.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 19:12</strong></p>
<p>Who knows, maybe when you figure out his name it'll tie up a couple ends.</p>
<p>Have you only witness SC's in and outs from the Whimsy or have you actually gone inside?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 19:13</strong></p>
<p>I have no idea how a goblin could gain citizenship here.&nbsp; I could ask for legal advice however if there might be a means to do so?&nbsp; My representator is in town but it's a long treck.&nbsp; I don't think I'd get much else done in a day if I sought him out.</p>
<h3><mark class="pen-red"><strong>[Peach’s messages appear in Base 64]</strong></mark></h3>
<p>I have never seen SC, at least not that I know of.</p>
<p>Is this better by the way?</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 19:15</strong></p>
<p>This is much better, it actually helps eliminate a step</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 19:15</strong></p>
<p>Can anyone understand me better or should I switch back to my other connection?</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 19:16</strong></p>
<p>This way is much better</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 19:16</strong></p>
<p>Step?&nbsp; Regardless that's good.&nbsp; I'll see how long I can maintain this.&nbsp; It's not a very strong connection but if it works better I'll use this.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 19:17</strong></p>
<p>If it'll extend transmissions then you can go back to the previous one, it's not hard to translate in my opinion.</p>
<p>It's a two step process to decode usually, the new way made it one.</p>
<p>I have a couple questions though, if you don't mind.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 19:20</strong></p>
<p>It was a bit of a change but it does make it easier in the end, thank you</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 19:24</strong></p>
<p>The connection is just weaker.&nbsp; Might have a few more interruptions is all.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 19:29</strong></p>
<p>I have a couple questions relating to things I've seen in the past. The first cypher's answer was "Doublelock does not care." Would you happen to know what that would be in relation to? And also, if Bruno from Recruiting was a person of interest in all of this.</p>
<p>And who is all of the official heads of the research departments? Besides Pauchik, Planar, and Engineering.</p>
<p>Those are my only questions thus far</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 19:37</strong></p>
<p>Doublelock does not care is an old saying.&nbsp; It means that fate is blind and what will happen will.&nbsp; It's an admission that your life isn't necessarily in your hands and bad things happen to good people but that's life.</p>
<p>Engineering doesn't have a head.&nbsp; I can find out who the Planar department head is currently but I usually ignore it because it changes so often.&nbsp; Pauchik is just a researcher he is not a head.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 19:39</strong></p>
<p>Oh I thought he was.</p>
<p>Is knowing who the heads of the departments matter or will we know over time?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 19:40</strong></p>
<p>Genevieve Zuchterin is the current head of planar.&nbsp; Nope, Pauchik is just a researcher who occassional does maintenance.</p>
<p>Necromancy is run by Emel Getrank.</p>
<p>I suppose knowing their names might help with communication?&nbsp; The department head names are very available to me and everyone else here.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Caught another message. Hold on.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 19:45</strong></p>
<p>I'm keeping personal writtn notes so I can keep better track of what's going on, so I'm trying to fill in blanks.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 19:46</strong></p>
<p>This one isn't coded so it must not be to a department head.&nbsp; Looks like Researcher Hyles is meeting with Culture again today.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 19:47</strong></p>
<p>Oh my, I wonder what about.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 19:52</strong></p>
<p>Hmm... Curious. I wonder what he's up to?</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 19:53</strong></p>
<p>Who knows. For now I wouldn't worry too much about it</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 19:54</strong></p>
<p>Well, when it comes to Researcher Hyles, I need to know, cause I might be meeting with him for his entertainment work in the future. I need to know what to avoid discussing, so as not to blow our cover</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 19:55</strong></p>
<p>Fair enough I suppose xD</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 20:20</strong></p>
<p>Hey just so we can iron out the details on the researchers on our ends, do you happen to know which departments Hyles, March, Freeman, and Marino work in and their relative standing in the hierarchy of the departments?</p>
<h3><mark class="pen-red"><strong>[Peach’s messages appear in reverse Base 64]</strong></mark></h3>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 21:07</strong></p>
<p>I had a small amount of aetherial backlash but I'm back.&nbsp; I re-established the connection but it looks like I'm not going to attempt what I did last time.&nbsp; I'm sorry if this is more difficult to understand.&nbsp; If I had access to more equipment maybe this would be easier.</p>
<p>Good question Chuck.&nbsp; I unfortunately have limitations on finding out because everyone of their personelle files have been moved to a place beyond my clearance.&nbsp; I have done some digging on this however already.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 21:11</strong></p>
<p>It's no problem Peach, it's only a small extra step that we have to deal with in interpreting it, it's no bother and if it's easier for you then that's what we have to work with.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 21:15</strong></p>
<p>Henceforth I will be referring to the researcher who writes in orange as Researcher Orange.&nbsp; Hyles seems to have worked quite often with Culture but I have not confirmed his department or status.&nbsp; I do know he must at least be of researcher standing if not a field agent.&nbsp; Orange I can confirm is a field agent on Project Grindstone but is involvment is unclear and I have no confirmation of the association with "Cami".&nbsp; Marino have no confirmation on identity, standing, or department.&nbsp; March seems to be working with Infenal Affairs and Janet but department is unclear.&nbsp; She does have status as a field researcher however, this much I can confirm.&nbsp; My suspicions are that VC is extra-planar but I'm not certain from where.</p>
<p>Very well Chuck, if my communication becomes too combersome ever let me know.&nbsp; I could get equipment to improve my connection but it would take time, I could also maybe have it constructed but that would take much, much longer but it would be safest.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 21:25</strong></p>
<p>That could be a good idea, if you end up connecting to different access points while getting new information then it could get cumbersome. We'll have to discuss it further amongst ourselves but that could be very useful further down the line.</p>
<p>Could you remind me what VC is?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 22:35</strong></p>
<p>VC is someone that has been met with regularly outside of UMAD facilities by researchers at the Wizard's Whimsy in town.</p>
<p>I say regularly but there seems to be no schedule.&nbsp; Also I accidently said VC I meant SC…</p>
<p>You can tell I haven't slept.&nbsp; Working on this in combination with my regular work has been...exhausting.</p>
<p>The rotational error on the code is almost completely worked out...I think.&nbsp; It's hard to tell, it all comes out as code afterall.&nbsp; Also, do we have an idea for at least one last member?&nbsp; Do we have a plan for who will be in which department?</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 22:45</strong></p>
<p>No problem, we all get tired sometimes, make sure to take care of yourself Peach, don't over-exert yourself. We have an idea for someone, but they haven't been online in a while. In regards to departments, I've decided to go with Alchemy, and I know TheShades has gone for Aetherial Studies, Snow for Necromancy and Brandon for Culture</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 22:54</strong></p>
<p>We're also looking at AgentMajin for the last spot, but he's hard to get ahold of. We might be looking at others, but we'll see.</p>
<p>And I agree, please get some rest. If you're too tired, you stand a better chance of slipping up and getting caught, so rest up</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 23:01</strong></p>
<p>A pinch of alchemist dust and I'll be fine.&nbsp; What is Butcher doing?</p>
<p>Looks like he reached out.&nbsp; It'll be good to have a team that can see every department.&nbsp; Still waiting on him to respond to me.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Yesterday at 23:37</strong></p>
<p>Sadly, it's a no-go. Majin has a super packed schedule with work, so he's unable to help. He's promised to not mention you, so we should be safe. Now we seek someone else to fill that last spot</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Yesterday at 23:38</strong></p>
<p>Unfortunate but I'm sure we'll find the sixth person sooner or later</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 23:38</strong></p>
<p>That's disappointing.&nbsp; Any leads on whom you might ask?</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Yesterday at 23:39</strong></p>
<p>We're working on it</p>
<h2>3rd August 2021</h2>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 19:24</strong></p>
<p>I've fixed the rotational error.&nbsp; I should have the message to you today.&nbsp; This isn't like any application material ciphers however, this is part of their security.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 19:40</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for your hard work Peach</p>
<p>Maybe whatever is in the message will hopefully help us in the future. Maybe a clue on what's going on with the Project perhaps.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:01</strong></p>
<p>Not certain but at the very least it'll help me understand communication between department heads.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 20:13</strong></p>
<p>Could you remind me who this message is going to and from?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:31</strong></p>
<p>I'm not certain.&nbsp; The message was intercepted by aetherial net and was sent by air elemental.&nbsp; I captured it to use as a sample for the encryption used by UMAD officials outside of my clearance.&nbsp; By having this I hope to lean how to decipher the script efficiently.&nbsp; I need someone to be able to decipher it and explain to me the process.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 20:32</strong></p>
<p>I mean, I'll try my best if you wanted to share here. I'm pretty sure we all will.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:32</strong></p>
<p>We got this. Might take us a bit, but given we've cracked the codes so far, I think we can pull it off</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 20:32</strong></p>
<p>Or maybe individually communicate with us as to keep it away from the server?</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 20:39</strong></p>
<p>We can at least give it a go</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 23:56</strong></p>
<p>Another messaged me?</p>
<h2>4th August 2021</h2>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Yesterday at 23:57</strong></p>
<p>Yeah we're attempting to get another person, sounds like they found you</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:17</strong></p>
<p>I've been staring at this too long.&nbsp; I think it's your tun to try.</p>

<p>Thank you for finding this! Have faith in us, we'll crack it in no time!</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:23</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, with this we won't be limited on intellegence we can gather due to code.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 01:29</strong></p>
<p>So much to catch up on. I forsee a lot of reading in my near future. Still, its good to be back</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 18:06</strong></p>
<p>Just to keep you up to date: We've been working on the cipher since last night. As this is clearly a Multi-Level Encryption, it's gonna take some time to crack. We think we've gotten past one level, but not much more than that.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 18:23</strong></p>
<p>Is there anything else you can learn about this transmission that might clue us in. I'm sure we're missing something, but we've tried a TON of decryption methods, and found nothing.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:38</strong></p>
<p>The message is only the end of a message.&nbsp; As for what I know about the encrption, I know it was created during the revolution by The Headmaster himself before he was ever The Headmaster.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 18:39</strong></p>
<p>What's the Headmaster's Name, by chance?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:46</strong></p>
<p>No one calls him by his name anymore but it's Samuel Ehrenhaft Schreiber.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 18:49</strong></p>
<p>Did he go by any other nicknames, besides Headmaster now? If he invented this encryption method, he likely named it something based on himself, so any info on him might point us in the right direction.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 19:04</strong></p>
<p>The Headmaster is his title.&nbsp; He doesn't have any nicknames as far as I know.&nbsp; He is a masterclass cryptologist, mathmatician, and aetherial specialist.&nbsp; A real polymath and polyglot.&nbsp; He has in recent years not been very visible to the public or within the walls of UMAD however.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 19:52</strong></p>
<p>Any other questions?</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 19:53</strong></p>
<p>Weird question, does your alphabet have 26 basic characters? Like ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 23:12</strong></p>
<p>We have alphanumeric characters but they often differ regionally.&nbsp; The script type I've adopted is common with communication these intervals and it seems that you also use it which is strange but convienent.&nbsp; With that said, not every form of communication is efficiently provided by distance communication in this way.&nbsp; In fact it takes several additional steps to use simple characters like these.</p>
<p>There are several standard character methods of communication that exist.&nbsp; Some are entirely numerical.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 23:19</strong></p>
<p>Ok, now that gets my attention. So far, the one aspect of the Cipher we've been able to crack has lead to nothing but a series of Numbers, but we haven't gotten further than that.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 23:24</strong></p>
<p>I'm glad I might be able to point you in the right direction.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 23:44</strong></p>
<p>Seems UMAD is making their move. I assume you see what is going on in the Main Chat?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 23:47</strong></p>
<p>Random is inefficient and can lead to a waste of UMAD resources.&nbsp; I don't trust it was random selection.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 23:48</strong></p>
<p>Then who else did they contact, and why? As far as I know, none of us got that message.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 23:49</strong></p>
<p>I've started outlining what I'll need for new equipment to make my communication more efficient for everyone.&nbsp; Some of these items are going to be difficult to find without being suspicious.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Who knows?&nbsp; Did this person put something on the google that would make them suspicious?&nbsp; Did they say something strange in chat ever?&nbsp; Sometimes the littlest things set off UMAD.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 23:50</strong></p>
<p>Don't take too big a risk. We're able to communicate fine for now, so only make changes if you feel it's safe. With UMAD on the move again, we can't afford to be careless</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 23:51</strong></p>
<p>They have waited so long for a second mission...&nbsp; This is very unusual.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 23:53</strong></p>
<p>We're suspecting they're trying to draw you out, since they have no clue the rest of us are involved. It's especially telling that the person posting this has barely been active in the main chat until this moment. Why them? That's a red flag to me.</p>
<p>Or perhaps this "Leslie" is one of them in disguise. Might be looking for others to help keep an eye out for people like us.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 23:56</strong></p>
<p>UMAD values loyalty.&nbsp; The most common saying in UMAD is "Need to know" while the second is "Compliance will be rewarded".&nbsp; The latter is typically heard by the employee groups outside of research, war prisoners, or those wanting a second chance at life that have been locked away.</p>
<p>Although the criminal elelment is not always willing...&nbsp; Usually it's the idea of family members acting as surrogates in their incarceration trying to pay off old debts, usually legal debts from the publuic cases.</p>
<p>Many people are trying to push against such action but who really wants to represent the criminal element in a country trying to rebuild itself after wartime?</p>
<h2>5th August 2021</h2>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:00</strong></p>
<p>Possible that Leslie is but what do they gain by presenting this information?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 00:01</strong></p>
<p>Best Guess: Given they know someone like you is out there. They may be trying to see if someone will say something to tip them off. I bet if one of us asked why we didn't get one, they'd start questioning us.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:09</strong></p>
<p>As long as we keep safe we have a team now that can investigate each of the departments at least.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 00:13</strong></p>
<p>And clearly, we're smart enough to not fall for an obvious trap. We've been talking in Private while working on the Cipher, and I can say I'm confident our team can pull this off. It's just a matter of cracking these codes.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 00:40</strong></p>
<p>We have another Singer joining the Server, Cami-Cat. We brought her up before, so I suspect she's another researcher.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 00:41</strong></p>
<p>Speaking of, Peach I think I might have an idea who the mysterious Researcher Orange might be</p>
<p>I know you mentioned that you'd need higher clearance to be sure but I might as well say the name so that in case he pops up anywhere you can let us know. They go by The Stupendium online? He's worked with Cami-Cat a few times and has a bit of an orange motif around the icons they use, in particular his channel logo</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 01:29</strong></p>
<p>Hey peach I got a message from UMAD management</p>

<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 01:30</strong></p>
<p>Just like that other person</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 01:35</strong></p>
<p>@Peach We think we got it. Took some work, and had to research a bit, but here's what we got: We reversed the Code, then used what we call "Base64" to decode it into numbers. Then we treated one number, 76, as a Space, and ran it through another Cipher, called a homophonic cipher, and while it's not perfect, we got this:</p>

<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:16</strong></p>
<p>The text seems to mostly make sense?&nbsp; I think I can work with that however.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 02:16</strong></p>
<p>I'm working on cleaning it up a bit more so we get a fuller picture</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:17</strong></p>
<p>There's also a very odd thing. One of those Names is VERY Familiar: John Tague.</p>
<p>Simply put: That's MY name. Had a bit to talk about with that one.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:17</strong></p>
<p>Snow, it looks like UMAD is getting a bit more aggressive.&nbsp; It must be getting to them..&nbsp; my email that is.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:18</strong></p>
<p>If you hadn't mentioned this was from the Revolution, I'd be looking very suspicious right now</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:18</strong></p>
<p>Oh Dear...</p>
<p>It's not from the revolution.&nbsp; The code was developed during that time.&nbsp; I intercepted that message only a few intervals ago.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:19</strong></p>
<p>There are more than a Few John Tagues out there, so it's not too worrysome, but that is one hell of a coincidence.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:20</strong></p>
<p>If you say so...</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:20</strong></p>
<p>While I can't prove my innocence with this, I can ask you to give me a chance to prove myself, so I can earn your trust, cause I know I'm not in the best of lights right now</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:22</strong></p>
<p>You were the one to solve the message.&nbsp; What is everyone else's thoughts?&nbsp; I think it's likely you are involved somehow or are in danger and therfore involved somehow...&nbsp; Or it's all a very eerie coincidence.</p>
<p>I'll look into this The Stupendium a little closer...</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 02:24</strong></p>
<p>It's certainly weird, I'm piecing the cipher together and it looks like it might be "John Tague of Reddit" so it's likely they just found a reddit post by someone by the name of John Tague, which again could be anyone</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:24</strong></p>
<p>Regardless the Cipher seems at least mostly correct...&nbsp; This will be very good for us.&nbsp; I'll be able to start gathering information from correspondences between dpartment heads.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:25</strong></p>
<p>Glad to know we could help. This was a good test on what we could do, so now we see what other challenges come next. We'll get to the bottom of this soon.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:27</strong></p>
<p>I'm going to put my project of improving communication aside and begin getting what information I can from department correspondences.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:28</strong></p>
<p>Good Idea. We've actually found a way to further streamline translating your messages, so we can easily afford to keep things the way they are. Focus on the bigger priority for now</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:34</strong></p>
<p>Can you show me where I can find more information on this cipher type?</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 02:35</strong></p>
<p>We used this, I'm trying to wrangle the plaintext into something more coherent and I'm making steady progress <a href="https://www.dcode.fr/homophonic-cipher"><u>https://www.dcode.fr/homophonic-cipher</u></a></p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:36</strong></p>
<p>You can also find the Base64 Decoder there as well.</p>
<p>We also used this to Reverse the text: <a href="http://spellbackwards.com/"><u>http://spellbackwards.com/</u></a></p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:44</strong></p>
<p>Base64 is a kind of encoding format. In fact, it's what your messages appear to us as, only in reverse, hence the other site I suggested.</p>
<p>@ChuckMorris You tested the Homophonic Cipher, didn't you? Can you explain it? I'm not as versed in it.</p>
<p><span class="text-big"><mark class="pen-red"><strong>[Translation shenanigans begin]</strong></mark></span></p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:45</strong></p>
<p>Maybe I should try converting it through this tool?</p>
<p>Is this better?</p>
<p>I forgot to reverse it.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 02:46</strong></p>
<p>It's essentially works as a substitution table, you can group multiple numbers to one letter and end up being able to encrypt in different combinations</p>
<p>For example if you write ABC and A could be encrypted as 1, 2, 3; B could be encrypted as 4, 5, 6; C can be encrypted as 7, 8, 9 etc, then you can write ABC as 147 or 359 or anything like that</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:47</strong></p>
<p>I see, is there a key?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:48</strong></p>
<p>It's just a matter of figuruing out the pattern.</p>
<p>Also, I think you're using the Base64 page wrong. You're accidently Double-Coding your Messages. I just figured out why I couldn't translate it at first</p>
<p>Here, for translating your messages, we've found a more streamline method: <a href="https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#recipe=Reverse(%27Character%27)From_Base64(%27A-Za-z0-9%2B/%3D%27,true)"><u>https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#recipe=Reverse(%27Character%27)From_Base64(%27A-Za-z0-9%2B/%3D%27,true)</u></a></p>
<p>Just put your message in the "Input" box, and it will put the translated text in the "Output" box</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:52</strong></p>
<p>testing</p>
<p>Does this read any better?</p>
<p>How about now?</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 02:55</strong></p>
<p>That's nearly perfect, just reverse it one more time</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:55</strong></p>
<p>This seems tedious.&nbsp; let me know if it's helping.</p>
<p>Now?</p>
<p><span class="text-big"><mark class="pen-red"><strong>[Translation shenanigans end]</strong></mark></span></p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 02:55</strong></p>
<p>That's perfect</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:55</strong></p>
<p>Hey! That did the trick!</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:55</strong></p>
<p>Seems like a lot.</p>
<p>You did this every time?</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 02:56</strong></p>
<p>Yup</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:56</strong></p>
<p>Once we figured it out, we were able to streamline the process, so all we had to do was Copy and Paste the code, and we'd have the translation.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:56</strong></p>
<p>It'll last until I need to reconnect.&nbsp; Hopefully that isn't for awhile...</p>
<p>At least I have a process now.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:57</strong></p>
<p>If that happens, and it changes, we can figure it out, and tell you quickly how to adapt</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:58</strong></p>
<p>It seems that the homophonic cipher has an exact key.&nbsp; Once I have that I can use it on my tricky quill to translate the cipher to real speak.&nbsp; After that we just have to wait until I find something relevant.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:58</strong></p>
<p>Either way, that's a win for the PITS!</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 03:01</strong></p>
<p>Infernal affairs has a process for acquiring new clearance certificates should a previous one be damaged or lost.&nbsp; It does bill to your employee account but the documents necessary for higher clearance levels don't exactly have a public way of being acquired.&nbsp; It also is not certain who has what clearance level within the heads of the departments.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 03:03</strong></p>
<p>I'm sure we'll figure that out soon enough. We now have the means to learn about a lot of new things regarding UMAD and their operations.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 03:03</strong></p>
<p>My thought is if I can gain insight onto the communication between departments maybe I can learn about these clearance documents.&nbsp; The issue is it will soon be known if a department head applies for a replacement.</p>
<p>True</p>
<p>Once you have a full key for characters send it to me.</p>
<p>I'll then program my tricky quill and it'll only be a matter of time.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 03:04</strong></p>
<p>We're quite close, we only have a few more characters to enter</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 03:25</strong></p>
<p>Tricky quill? Is that how you communicate?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 03:26</strong></p>
<p>They are just efficient.&nbsp; Aetherial multi-dimensional structures overlapping a material object, a quill in this case, that has basic command words.&nbsp; Very good for taking notes.</p>
<p>You can have them record on parchment other people however if you get good at programming them.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 03:27</strong></p>
<p>Fascinating</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 03:28</strong></p>
<p>I'll have them listen in on a few of the department heads or people of interest.&nbsp; Just need to decide on who first.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 04:03</strong></p>
<p>Ok we seem to have organised this a bit more, we've ended up with this:&nbsp;</p>
<p>WHICH IS TO BE EXPECTED. FROM HERE ON OUT, PLEASE ADHERE TO THE RENEWED GUIDELINES WHICH ARE OUTLINED IN THE MEMORANDUMS HANDED OUT LAST AUVAL.</p>
<p>THE FOLLOWING RESOURCES AND COMPONENTS ARE REQUIRED, FOR RESEARCH AND EXPERIMENTATION.</p>

<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 04:04</strong></p>
<p>Interesting. What is an Auval?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:04</strong></p>
<p>It's one of nine intervals.</p>
<p>Like Belval.</p>
<p>It's about 30 part.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 04:06</strong></p>
<p>Interesting</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:07</strong></p>
<p>Is there another John Tague who is TheShades?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 04:08</strong></p>
<p>That's doubtful. So now I'm no longer a Suspect... I'm a Target</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 04:08</strong></p>
<p>As far as I know, there's only the one</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:08</strong></p>
<p>I don't really think that is a victory for you.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 04:09</strong></p>
<p>Why do they want Shades though? Surely there are other Vtubers they could use</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:09</strong></p>
<p>Maybe they suspect him of something?&nbsp; Maybe it's his involvement on "Reddit"?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 04:10</strong></p>
<p>Here's the Key we used to decipher this thing:</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:219px;"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/qy2_EA5K0wCIWsi2TKVbRd5jVu-FyGJgWPtzVRbDjZeDa3c4d4lopHstJh-5jnxdnSObfeZ8DDTFaNaU1hobuPaTkdFa5_aQCu4n-p-Ub0jjMTyuU1CAr4nj0UCB89IsohSmpxLe"></figure>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:10</strong></p>
<p>Maybe it's just because he is here?</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 04:10</strong></p>
<p>:calebh4HM:</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 04:11</strong></p>
<p>But they found me on Reddit, and that's not even my home, AND they got my Real Name. It's not exactly hidden, but they had to dig a little to find that info. Why go through all that for me</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 04:11</strong></p>
<p>In which case, they may know about the rest of us as well. We should probably stay cautious</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:11</strong></p>
<p>Excellent.&nbsp; It shouldn't take me long to get the quills ready.&nbsp; Maybe I should have them copy Admin correspondences?&nbsp; Although Necromancy or Culture seem useful.</p>
<p>I mean no offense when I say this especially due to the nature of information retrieval assignments.&nbsp; If we are compromised the message doesn't look the best for you.</p>
<p>Just be careful and... don't take any deals with them.</p>
<p>On the other hand, maybe we can use this somehow.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 04:15</strong></p>
<p>I'll be Careful. I've informed my Wife of the Situation. If anything happens to me, she'll make sure to deal with it. They may be powerful beings. But as we like to say here "Hell Hath No Fury Like a Woman Scorned"</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:16</strong></p>
<p>That's good.&nbsp; Make certain those close to you know.</p>
<p>If I set the quills up with culture maybe I can find a lead on Researcher Hyles.&nbsp; It seems relevant given your relationship.&nbsp; If I set up at Admin I might be able to figure out a number of things with Janet.&nbsp; It also concerns me that the Cami-Cat you mentioned came to the discord.&nbsp; If I get in at Necromancy maybe we can gain more intelligence on the investigation for us.&nbsp; Thoughts?</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 04:21</strong></p>
<p>What do you think is best? I have mixed feelings when it comes to Researcher Hyles but gaining intelligence on the investigation doesn't sound like a bad idea</p>
<p>As for Cami, I couldn't begin to guess at her angle</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:23</strong></p>
<p>Mixed feelings how?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 04:23</strong></p>
<p>Chuck has been Contacted. Seems he's under watch since he solved the first Cipher they gave out.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:24</strong></p>
<p>They are contacting a lot of people today it seems…</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 04:24</strong></p>
<p>They seem to be congratulating me but I'll have to be very careful</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:624px;"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/vMUeHnwHLxeS34xVfBa62-b2U41CN0TLhgTlzr36ABLccOUhYDw0JSvFKgA1LxT2EonswRHnICExRanHVe1J4RC84fP82HDxQkCAoRxXwPxe55GUggXiSM77XBZYonyGybsPJYIO"></figure>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:29</strong></p>
<p>I do suggest it.</p>
<p>I'm not the only one investigating here.&nbsp; I welcome the recommendations from you.&nbsp; Necromancy has enhanced security right now, I don't know if we will have a chance in the future with them but they might also cool down later.&nbsp; If we investigate Janet's messages I think we are more likely to get something as she gets many, many correspondences every interval.&nbsp; I don't mean to not prioritize your safety but it might be pragmatic to not look into the situation with Hyles and culture yet with our limited resources.&nbsp; You aren't meeting with Hyles for some time correct?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 04:33</strong></p>
<p>If it happens, it'll be towards the end of the month on the 24th</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 04:34</strong></p>
<p>Oh also Peach I was going to give my tuppence on the matter of where to go first. I think if we go for Admin first then we can get more insight on Janet, who seems to be someone who gets general gossip and more inter-departmental stuff, which in regards to Project Grindstone seems very helpful as we know that it's inter-departmental. Plus you mentioned her hands were stained with orange ink which implies she knows more about the situation with Cami-Cat, which since she has joined the server I'd say can be quite an important topic.</p>
<p>So I think going with Janet will give us more all-around coverage which I think will be best for now, and we can branch out to individual departments when we get accepted and find more suspicious things once we're actually in them. What does everyone else think?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:34</strong></p>
<p>You mean next month?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 04:34</strong></p>
<p>No this month. August 24 in our time.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:35</strong></p>
<p>I suppose your months are different as well...</p>
<p>Not convienent still but that's fine.&nbsp; I'll just need to do more research.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 04:35</strong></p>
<p>We have an odd structure, but we average around 30 days a month, give or take a day.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:37</strong></p>
<p>You make a very good point Chuck.&nbsp; I'd like to hear from the rest.&nbsp; I intend to set up these quills in only a few parts.&nbsp; That is an odd structure.&nbsp; What do you mean average?&nbsp; We get the same 5 weeks each month... Two months in the season.</p>
<p>Nine interval to the week...</p>
<p>And so on.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 04:38</strong></p>
<p>Most months are 30 days, but some are 31, and one month is 28 for some reason. Even we don't get it ourselves. It's just how it is.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 04:38</strong></p>
<p>Yeah our months vary a bit in terms of exactly how many days they are</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 04:39</strong></p>
<p>Even wierder is that every four years, that 28 day month gets an extra day, making it 29 days. Yes, it's as weird as it sounds</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:40</strong></p>
<p>Confusing.&nbsp; I'll try to keep track better.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 04:40</strong></p>
<p>How long is a part for you?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 04:40</strong></p>
<p>Good luck. If not for our technology reminding us what day it is, we'd lilkely not keep track ourselves</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:41</strong></p>
<p>That only leaves 20 intereval before meeting Caleb?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 04:41</strong></p>
<p>Sounds about right</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 04:41</strong></p>
<p>More or less</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 04:41</strong></p>
<p>A day here is 24 hours, which equates to about 1440 of your plane's ticks if I remember correctly</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:41</strong></p>
<p>50 tick</p>
<p>Not quite.&nbsp; A tick if I recall is a little shorter than your minute.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 04:43</strong></p>
<p>Point being we have a while before Shades chats with Caleb if it happens</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:44</strong></p>
<p>So Chuck thinks we should investigate Admin.&nbsp; What say you Shades?&nbsp; Brandon? Snow?&nbsp; Butcher?&nbsp; Gruffles?</p>
<p>I do hope Butcher is okay, I haven't heard from them in awhile.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 04:45</strong></p>
<p>I'm in agreement. BEst to cast a wide net for now</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 04:45</strong></p>
<p>Works for me</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 04:46</strong></p>
<p>Butcher has told us they're sick so they weren't going to be active for a few days, they did talk to us a little bit earlier but hopefully they get better soon</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:46</strong></p>
<p>If no one disagrees in the next few parts then I'll set things up.</p>
<p>I do hope it isn't serious</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 04:56</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes I surprise myself.&nbsp; I got the new command words programmed.&nbsp; The quills are ready.&nbsp; Just had to duplicate the structure a few times and cut off redundant lines.</p>
<p>I should go install these.&nbsp; Do any of you need anything or have questions before I go?</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 05:00</strong></p>
<p>None from me, just make sure to be safe. It seems like the more we see the more they're looking.</p>
<p><strong>Sir Gruffles — Today at 05:16</strong></p>
<p>Apologies Peach. Duty called for longer than I had anticipated. I'm definitely game to start with Admin before attempting other departments.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 08:43</strong></p>
<p>Now that I'm caught up I agree in researching Admin. I was thinking that if you wanted one of us to infiltrate then Administration was my first thought, but then it was pointed out you need people for the research departments. Also would like to point out, what message did you send to UMAD to get them on high alert Peach? You said you sent them an email?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 15:32</strong></p>
<p>I did not send them an email.&nbsp; I gained access to their email and hid a file away so people like you could find me.</p>
<p>Duty?&nbsp; What is it that you do Gruffles?&nbsp; If you don't mind my asking.&nbsp; I understand if I'm overstepping here.&nbsp; With a name of Sir Gruffles and Duty it elicits an image of noble governance.&nbsp; Are you a vassal of some sort?&nbsp; A Lord or Baron?</p>
<p>I'll be collecting the notes that the quills have made soon by the way.</p>
<p><strong>Sir Gruffles — Today at 15:44</strong></p>
<p>Alas Peach, there is no nobility in my lineage. My duties are at a desk, in the Accounting department of my employer. I have dreams of reaching higher than this desk one day though.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 15:44</strong></p>
<p>Most of us here have Jobs outside of this. I'm one of the few that, thanks to my work being making videos online, can stay at home all day.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 15:45</strong></p>
<p>Nods I, too, have other obligations. So unfortunately I can’t be here all the time</p>
<p><strong>Sir Gruffles — Today at 15:47</strong></p>
<p>Sir Gruffles is an alias I created to protect my personal information.</p>
<p>Although at this point in time, I'm not worth much more than this name.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 15:48</strong></p>
<p>Don’t underestimate your own value Gruffles</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 16:17</strong></p>
<p>Okay the email is the stego image, got it. Sorry, some of the stuff is lost in translation for me since I joined late and power read through everything so if I mess up on some info I'm sorry and I thank you for correcting me.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 16:44</strong></p>
<p>Accounting is instrumental in operations and decision making in any entity.</p>
<p>There is no need to apologize Snow.</p>
<p>There is a large amount of notes from the quill.&nbsp; I'm looking through everything now.&nbsp; This was only a few part too…</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 16:49</strong></p>
<p>Anything stand out?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 16:49</strong></p>
<p>I'm hoping to find something soon.&nbsp; There is quite a bit.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 16:51</strong></p>
<p>We're standing by if you need us.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 17:50</strong></p>
<p>A few notes here.&nbsp; Some items are very strange though.&nbsp; I might want more time collecting correspondences but it looks like Janet recieves a lot of encypted messages.&nbsp; The first item of note is there is a new Planar department head starting in three intervals.&nbsp; This is never a surprise but they are being given advanced clearance.&nbsp; Level 11 to be specific.&nbsp; Sometimes department heads are designated level 10 with the occasional Planar head only squeezing out a level 9.&nbsp; Level 11 is the highest clearance a department head can be approved.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 17:53</strong></p>
<p>That's interesting. Any idea who the new head is?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 17:54</strong></p>
<p>Next I found not much is mentioned about Project Grindstone but it is mentioned often.&nbsp; I did find that it does directly have something to do with your plane however.&nbsp; The phrase Compulsory Consciousness and Permitted Consciousness are used quite a bit in regards to the project.&nbsp; I'm not sure what is meant by that.</p>
<p>No name was given so far to who the new head will be.</p>
<p>Another strange thing was not every message going to Janet was for Janet.&nbsp; I believe she may be forwarding these messages elsewhere.</p>
<p>What I don't understand is why they would need Janet to forward information.&nbsp; Why not infernal affairs or someone else in administration?</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 17:57</strong></p>
<p>So Janet is acting as an intermediary. Is that unusual?</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 17:58</strong></p>
<p>Could be something confidential... Or maybe some other organization is involved.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 17:58</strong></p>
<p>Compulsory and Permitted. I have a Feeling about what that's about, and it's not a good thing...</p>
<p>I get the sense we're talking Free Will (Permitted) and Obeying a Master (Compulsory)</p>
<p>That's scary</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 17:59</strong></p>
<p>Are you suggesting they're brainwashing people?</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 18:00</strong></p>
<p>That makes sense and would be a reason why so many test subjects are needed</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 18:00</strong></p>
<p>They may be attempting to, or at least indoctrinating them</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 18:00</strong></p>
<p>It would also make sense in regards to how they're reaching out to individual people now - it could be one of the next stages of their plan</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:01</strong></p>
<p>It's not really her job.&nbsp; People often think of her as a secretary which is offensive to her.&nbsp; She however has been seated at a front desk when you enter the tower so...&nbsp; She mostly manages onboarding and employee complaints.&nbsp; Occasionally it's client complaints however.&nbsp; Since she is seated in a convienent place she has started managing schedules, something about it being efficient for resource utilization.&nbsp; She however is not responsible for forwarding messages of this level of security.&nbsp; that could easily be handled by those in correspondence.&nbsp; Furthermore if the message was extra-planar then why not send to the Planar Department?</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 18:02</strong></p>
<p>Unless the Planar Department is out of the loop</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 18:02</strong></p>
<p>Could it be a power grab? Maybe she's consolidating her power for some reason?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:03</strong></p>
<p>I don't think that is the aim but Culture is very good at assisting admin with employee efficiency and compliance.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 18:03</strong></p>
<p>Well it could also have to do with the application process and the applicants since she has a heavy hand in that stuff</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 18:05</strong></p>
<p>It may not be her main goal, but given what we know, Maybe it's a means to an end. My theory is they got spooked about your involvement, and are trying to speed things up to prevent you from figuring it out in time. By making things as efficient as possible, they could certainly do that.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 18:06</strong></p>
<p>Security is double downed so it would make sense.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:07</strong></p>
<p>I also have insight on your next mission.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 18:07</strong></p>
<p>Ooh please indulge</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 18:07</strong></p>
<p>Saw you were asking about me, Peach. Hello, Im back and doing well.</p>
<p>And next mission? Im all ears</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 18:07</strong></p>
<p>Yes, We're Ready. After last night's success, I want to learn more, especially since I'm now a target</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:08</strong></p>
<p>They are organizing a series of tests and getting other researchers involved in the process.&nbsp; The resulting answer to it all will be a single word.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 18:08</strong></p>
<p>Hmm</p>
<p>That's good to know</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:08</strong></p>
<p>One of the research teams involved will be the Planar department.</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 18:09</strong></p>
<p>Well that would make sense if its heavily involved in out plane. Youd want planar studying the foreign plane angle</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 18:10</strong></p>
<p>We haven't even figured out who is in which department though so who knows which researcher is taking the lead</p>
<p>Ral</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 18:10</strong></p>
<p>Wonder if has anything to do with that code Snow Found from Leslie's post? I wouldn't be surprised if that was instead a clue for people to use, but many would have overlooked.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:10</strong></p>
<p>They plan on sending you to an augmented world by means of your technology with visual filters.&nbsp; To you it might appear like a game but there is more there.&nbsp; They will be watching closely for anyone who strays from the test as a potential conspirator.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 18:11</strong></p>
<p>oh boy. We're getting to deep stuff, now</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 18:12</strong></p>
<p>Interesting. So it'll be difficult to dig for more info but there is almost certainly something to going off the 'intended path'</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 18:12</strong></p>
<p>That makes sense to use a AR tool since the next test was supposed to be a field test anyway. If past tests say anything.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:12</strong></p>
<p>Indigo&nbsp; That's an emergency word here.&nbsp; Claiming Indigo without proper clearance can land you into deep trouble.&nbsp; Using Indigo means to operate without approval from accounting and accept expenses later.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 18:13</strong></p>
<p>Oh no should I take down my finding then on the general chat? Or do you think it's too late?</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 18:13</strong></p>
<p>Too late. Undoubtedly the others have seen it already</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:13</strong></p>
<p>Saying Indigo isn't the same as claiming it in operation.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 18:14</strong></p>
<p>Oh man. So why would they code a link to the website with that word. That seems... odd</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:14</strong></p>
<p>While it hasn't been expressed to you, you operate with a Level 2 clearance as an applicant.&nbsp; Clearance level 8 is the minimum requirement to claim Indigo.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 18:15</strong></p>
<p>Okay cool. I mainly did it to try to get on UMAD s good side. Showing I can do something, you know? Maybe it'll help me in the processes.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:15</strong></p>
<p>They might be trying to scare me.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 18:15</strong></p>
<p>Clearly not working</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:16</strong></p>
<p>Getting on their good side would be advantageous for us.&nbsp; I think whatever they want we need you all to perform the best you can.</p>
<p>If I'm ever to be found out it would be helpful for others to be able to work in my leave.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 18:16</strong></p>
<p>Without giving anything away of course lol</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:16</strong></p>
<p>Of Course.&nbsp; I'm sorry if that is demanding of you.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 18:17</strong></p>
<p>Of course not, I'm all for this team! Go PITS!</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 18:17</strong></p>
<p>Hey, We're in this for the long haul. Don't worry about it</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:18</strong></p>
<p>Unfortunately I don't know how much we will learn about Project Grindstone directly this way.&nbsp; It's uncertain what information we could learn, it may or may not be beneficial or quick.&nbsp; Getting a level 10 or 11 clearance would let me access some of the Project documents directly.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 18:19</strong></p>
<p>I will say this, if I go missing, or if I start acting weird, don't hesitate to cut me off. if I'm a target, I dread to think what they'll do to me, or worse... What they'll make me do.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:19</strong></p>
<p>I'm still sorting through everything I took today.&nbsp; We could move to another department or keep things here for now however.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 18:19</strong></p>
<p>Don't worry shades, I'll watch your every move for ya. Out of comradery, not fear</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 18:20</strong></p>
<p>Shades...you'll be fine. Just act casual. Don't give them any reason to suspect you're anything more than a particularly promising candidate. We got your back dude :slight_smile:</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 18:21</strong></p>
<p>At this point, that's no longer my concern. I know I can fake it well enough. But if I'm already a target, all the faking in the world ain't gonna help.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 18:21</strong></p>
<p>If things happen we work it out, we're a team after all.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 18:22</strong></p>
<p>I mean, it could lol. We got this guy's, just make sure not to let anything slip. Hell, even knowing doublelock is a god could land us in trouble</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 18:22</strong></p>
<p>We just need to work efficiently and covertly. Even answering the next mission too quickly can get more eyes on us</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 18:23</strong></p>
<p>With all the materials needed from the last correspondence, one would think we should keep an eye on either alchemy or necromancy right now</p>
<p>What do y'all think? Which department should peach look out for next?</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 18:24</strong></p>
<p>Necromancy is the department you're going into right Snow? Might not be a bad idea to have some inside info</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 18:25</strong></p>
<p>We each have a department we're heading to. Actually, Planar seems a good spot, since a lot of this stuff is in their jurisdicition</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 18:25</strong></p>
<p>Oh yeah, planar would be good to look out for</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 18:26</strong></p>
<p>Planar might be good since it pertains to the next mission, plus if it has a lot of field agents then we can find people to watch out for on our end</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 18:28</strong></p>
<p>If I've learned anything from some of the stuff I've done commentary for, Its to go where the clues lead you. A lot of that info mentions Planar stuff, so the next logical step is to look there.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 18:28</strong></p>
<p>Alright, I vote planar then</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 18:28</strong></p>
<p>Same here</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 18:31</strong></p>
<p>Hey Peach. Does the phrase: "Don't let the limits of indigo color your perspective" mean anything to you?</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 18:32</strong></p>
<p>I also vote planar</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 18:32</strong></p>
<p>And yes, planar sounds like a good choice to me as well</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:33</strong></p>
<p>I'm not familiar with the phrase Brandon.&nbsp; So you want me to move the quill to planar?</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 18:33</strong></p>
<p>Yes please</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:34</strong></p>
<p>It might take longer to generate information there but it may be more practical.&nbsp; I'mnot certain what we will hear for a few intervals however since they lack a department head at the moment.</p>
<p>I think Dowan might be making a pun.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 18:35</strong></p>
<p>Our thoughts as well:sweat_smile:</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 18:36</strong></p>
<p>Yeah even it takes longer it's well worth</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:36</strong></p>
<p>My apologies for taking awhile to get back to you.&nbsp; I'm still sifting through these.</p>
<p>All forwarded messages seem to be to the same individual.&nbsp; I think I can also confirm Researcher March is annapantsu but this isn't really news.</p>
<p>I can also confirm that Janet has recently begun observing the chat herself…</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 18:43</strong></p>
<p>Like as in under UMAD Management or hiding under a username?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:46</strong></p>
<p>I'm not certain.&nbsp; Maybe I can find more soon.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 18:57</strong></p>
<p>Well, we already knew Anna was involved</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 19:14</strong></p>
<p>Since there is a Clearence system, could we know what each levels are? You said applicants are level 2 and department heads range from 9-11 depending.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 19:36</strong></p>
<p>Looking through my noted you said they are looking for a new head of Planar already? What happened to Genevieve Zuchterin? Did she get Planes touched??</p>
<p>Also apparently I was slightly wrong on the decoding and it wasn't 'indigo' but 'indego'. I don't know if that makes a difference or not.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 19:39</strong></p>
<p>The system has levels of 1-15.&nbsp; First level clearance is applicable to those outside the system.&nbsp; Second level is the lowest level of clearance provided to those within UMAD.&nbsp; Employees outside of research have a clearance of three or four.&nbsp; Field researchers start at seven and go up to nine usually.&nbsp; Exceptions can be made.&nbsp; Your performance during your application would assist at higher clearance levels.&nbsp; You will not be informed as to your clearance level until it is either relevant or if you are given a level seven clearance.</p>
<p>Maybe it means nothing?&nbsp; The replaced e might also be to prevent the one reaching out from their operation being mistaken as indigo.&nbsp; Which means they aren't certain enough yet or don't find me as enough of a threat yet...&nbsp; That's good.</p>
<p>Or it's a test?</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 19:45</strong></p>
<p>It was labeled as a random selection test, but I think UMAD took it down after Leslie posted it up on the general chat.</p>
<p>Even TheShades tried almost immediately after it was posted and it was lead to a dead site.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 19:47</strong></p>
<p>The ends always need to be considered when it comes to UMAD.&nbsp; If the information leads to recruitment then they will usually let it slide but if it's an aptitude test and they think the purity of the test is valuable then they will react fast.&nbsp; Ultiamtely it's difficult to know how they will react but it's always a numbers game and according to Accounting how they react.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 19:49</strong></p>
<p>It's always about the numbers :face_exhaling:</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 19:49</strong></p>
<p>We should probably pass that along, covertly, to main chat somehow then. Avoid umad having to many warning bells because we all tend to publicly discuss and share things</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 19:50</strong></p>
<p>Everything said here with Peach needs to be kept confidential in case UMAD gets onto any of us though</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 19:50</strong></p>
<p>This fortunately has been kept under radar but these aptitude tests or surveys could also lead somewhere and if they're axed the second they go live... we'll miss something or bar access somewhere</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 19:51</strong></p>
<p>The test lead to a 404 page though</p>
<p>and it was meant for Leslie unfortunately</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 19:51</strong></p>
<p>I agree for the most part. Thats why i said covertly let people know the umad links probably should be kept to ones self, atleast publicly</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 19:52</strong></p>
<p>Ah yeah that would be smart. Like put it up as a theory type thing?</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 19:52</strong></p>
<p>Right</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 19:53</strong></p>
<p>I agree with that then. Put that out there then, just so you can try to gain brownie points as well. Let UMAD know that you're on the side of secrecy.</p>
<p>What does everyone else think?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 19:55</strong></p>
<p>Just be careful.&nbsp; The delivery could make things either easier or much, much more difficult for us.</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 19:57</strong></p>
<p>I'll work at the wording and submit it here for approval first then</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 19:59</strong></p>
<p>Janet does not seem to directly be forwarding the messages not addressed to her from her desk.&nbsp; She is either taking this information elsewhere or just not forwarding the messages at all.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 20:00</strong></p>
<p>She's withholding information?</p>
<p>Where is this elsewhere? Maybe something like a shredder?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:01</strong></p>
<p>That is a billable offense.&nbsp; I've never known Janet to be anything less than absolutely loyal.&nbsp; She has the opportunity to communicate with the Assistant Headmaster regularly.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 20:01</strong></p>
<p>If you get proof you may be able to report her</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:02</strong></p>
<p>These messages are communicated by transverse wave pattern not by script.&nbsp; This means by speach or air elemental.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 20:04</strong></p>
<p>Oh no. Is there any way for you to record any of the verbal messages? Like stick a recording stone or something to Janet's desk?</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 20:05</strong></p>
<p>If she rarely leaves her desk, that would be difficult to accomplish without being noticed</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 20:05</strong></p>
<p>SHE HAS TO SLEEP</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:06</strong></p>
<p>But she likely locks her office. We'd have to catch a very specific circumstance to pull that off, and odds are not in our favor</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:06</strong></p>
<p>I can't send you visual or audio information...&nbsp; All I can do is inform you on what I find.&nbsp; I can also investigate things from your world by your information and using The Google instrument.&nbsp; With proper direction of course.&nbsp; I have learned a lot from our conversations however.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 20:07</strong></p>
<p>Well even if you can't send it to us you could use it as proof to try to get her out of her seat and hopefully replace her with someone on our side</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:07</strong></p>
<p>The transverse waves by air elemental are provided in a queue at her direction but she has not physical office, just a desk.&nbsp; This means she only listens to her messages when she is not in the presence of others.</p>
<p>That's why I planted the quill.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 20:08</strong></p>
<p>Ah okay</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:08</strong></p>
<p>Seems rather inefficient to me. In our World, most Department Heads would have their own office for this very kind of thing.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:08</strong></p>
<p>All of ours do, except for her.</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 20:09</strong></p>
<p>She has no office, but accesses sensitive information? Seems like a security liability</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:09</strong></p>
<p>I've never been sure as to why...&nbsp; As for sleeping, sometimes I wonder if she does.&nbsp; She seems to always be there and she has no listed schedule.</p>
<p>Yet her record for maintaining sensitive information in impeccable.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:10</strong></p>
<p>I'm beginning to suspect she's not a living being at this point. No living creature could work like she does, that's for sure.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 20:10</strong></p>
<p>Maybe she has some kind of magic or elixir under her belt that makes sleep unneccesary.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 20:11</strong></p>
<p>Or she’s a zombie</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 20:11</strong></p>
<p>Or a construct as well! Expains why she can never be persuaded and such</p>
<p>Lol there IS a necromancy department so maybe??</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:11</strong></p>
<p>That's my thinking, especially with her emphasis on Effeciency, much like a Machine</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 20:12</strong></p>
<p>They do have a necromancy department, and an undead secretary lady who never needs to sleep and could handle sensitive info constantly would be quite useful</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:12</strong></p>
<p>I doubt she is undead.&nbsp; Chill are limited in their capacity here since they are easily manipulated.</p>
<p>Also, I have seen her eat at her desk.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:13</strong></p>
<p>We're just speculating, of course. But based on what you've told us, something doesn't add up. How can ANYTHING be that non-stop and yet still be as effecient as she is. There's something going on with her.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 20:13</strong></p>
<p>Agreed</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 20:14</strong></p>
<p>In our world one has to sleep in order to remain functional and, well, alive. Are there things in your world that can prevent the need for sleep?</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 20:15</strong></p>
<p>Or Snow is correct and she’s some sort of construct. Eating in order to maintain a “normal” appearance isn’t out of the question</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:16</strong></p>
<p>It's possible she utilizes a time dilation.&nbsp; There are risks but if she is familiar with the other plane she can freely travel without concerns of becoming plane touched.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 20:17</strong></p>
<p>:anguished:</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:17</strong></p>
<p>According to my notes she seems to be something of an expert on your plane as well.&nbsp; Although Culture would never claim as such her statements on it seem very well informed and reminiscent of some conversations we have had.</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 20:18</strong></p>
<p>Reminiscent how?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:18</strong></p>
<p>Maybe that's why this experiment is focused here. All the more reason to have someone in the Culture Dept. to look into it</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:23</strong></p>
<p>"Compulsory Consciousness is determined by the Permitted Conscious entities and by will.&nbsp; The will of these entities allow for adoption of the dynamic will of the Compulsory Conscious entities.&nbsp; This will exists as an external motivator for the action of the Compulsory Conscious but also grant stability..."</p>
<p>As you can see it's difficult to unpack this without much reference.</p>
<p>To answer you Butcher, she seems to know about things like the google instrument, reddit, conventions, VR, and a number of other topics.</p>
<p>How your time works…</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 20:25</strong></p>
<p>Those aren’t exactly uncommon knowledge around here. It just means she’s done her research</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:26</strong></p>
<p>I'm merely stating that's why they are familiar.&nbsp; She also has much more information.&nbsp; Technical notes.&nbsp; Answers to strange questions.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:26</strong></p>
<p>But it still goes with my theory, so long as we change a few words: "The Collective is Determined by the Free-Willed Entities and what they will. The WIll of these entities allow for the Adoption of the Changing Will of the Collective Entities. This will exists as an external motivator of the Collecitve, but also grant stability"</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:27</strong></p>
<p>What is Mixcraft?</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 20:27</strong></p>
<p>A recording software?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:28</strong></p>
<p>Like tricky Quill?</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 20:29</strong></p>
<p>A quick search and you’re on to something. It’s a recording program used by musicians apparently</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 20:29</strong></p>
<p>Yeah except it's our version and can edit and delete things from it.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:30</strong></p>
<p>So many things I'm unfamiliar with.&nbsp; I could just post them here and you explain I suppose.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 20:30</strong></p>
<p>And it's video software.</p>
<p>Okay let's see</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:30</strong></p>
<p>"My current setup for recording is an AT2020 microphone that connects via XLR to a Scarlett 2i2 interface. I record via Mixcraft 9 on my laptop in an enclosed space."</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:31</strong></p>
<p>Sounds like one of the Researchers/Singers.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 20:31</strong></p>
<p>That... Sounds like someone's setup from our plane</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:31</strong></p>
<p>Let me break this down to be safe</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:31</strong></p>
<p>That was a response from Janet however.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:32</strong></p>
<p>A Microphone is a tool for Recording Audio. The XLR&nbsp; is a Cable to Connect the Microphone to another Device, in this case the Scarlet 2i2, which allows us to connect it to a Computer.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 20:33</strong></p>
<p>Yeah because that is not my realm of expertise lol Weird, that would mean she has equipment from our plane there. Or like you said, she comes here…</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:33</strong></p>
<p>The Scarlet is a type of an AudioBox, as we call it</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:34</strong></p>
<p>She must have a very technical understanding of your world.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 20:35</strong></p>
<p>Have you ever seen what Cami-cat looks like?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:36</strong></p>
<p>I haven't, only heard about her from you.</p>
<p>You could always send me to an image, video, anything.&nbsp; I'm still not very good at navigating these tools.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:39</strong></p>
<p>Actually, I have just the thing: <a href="https://twitter.com/camicattweets/status/1351387682593767425"><u>https://twitter.com/camicattweets/status/1351387682593767425</u></a></p>
<p>She's the one in the Middle, along with Researcher Hyles on the Right</p>
<p>You might have to open the Link in Google to get the Video to play</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:40</strong></p>
<p>That's... Researcher Hyles definitely.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 20:40</strong></p>
<p>I'm thinking it may be ideal to show you the faces of some of these researchers you've never seen</p>
<p>Well, at least however she's involved</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:40</strong></p>
<p>She looks familiar and her voice seems familiar as well.&nbsp; Any stand alone audio?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:41</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fB479Soa6Q"><u>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fB479Soa6Q</u></a></p>
<p>I've been looking into her already, so I had this ready to go</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:42</strong></p>
<p>No way...&nbsp; I'm sorry I need a moment.&nbsp; I appologize from breaking from professionalism.&nbsp; I just don't understand.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 20:42</strong></p>
<p>It's fine, I figured she'd be important.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:43</strong></p>
<p>Please, give me another video.&nbsp; One not distorted in any way.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 20:43</strong></p>
<p>Will this do? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7OHWb9haMA"><u>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7OHWb9haMA</u></a></p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:43</strong></p>
<p>I need to hear that voice again.</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 20:43</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/vaSxGNq7g5k"><u>https://youtu.be/vaSxGNq7g5k</u></a></p>
<p>Heres one of just her voice. No singing</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:45</strong></p>
<p>I...don't understand.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 20:45</strong></p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:46</strong></p>
<p>I'm gonna take a shot in the dark... That's Janet, isn't it?</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 20:46</strong></p>
<p>What's going on peach</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:47</strong></p>
<p>The voices isn't quite deep enough but she definitely sounds so much like her...&nbsp; We can't let anyone know this yet.&nbsp; We need to hold onto this just in case.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 20:47</strong></p>
<p>Lol oh my</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:47</strong></p>
<p>I KNEW IT! Everything lined up. The big one was when you said she was watching the main chat, not long after Cami-Cat Joined the Server</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 20:48</strong></p>
<p>Janet wouldn't happen to have a twin, would she?</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 20:48</strong></p>
<p>Well well Cami. Perhaps I misjudged you…</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:48</strong></p>
<p>It makes sense, the messages were addressed to Camille.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:49</strong></p>
<p>We'll keep this quiet. Trust us, we don't want this getting out till we make our move. But this is huge.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:50</strong></p>
<p>So Cami is Janet…</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 20:50</strong></p>
<p>So your Janet and our Cami-Cat sound almost identical, and Janet is recieving messages addressed to a 'Camille'. Talk about a deep cover…</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:50</strong></p>
<p>Makes sense why she communicates often to Hyles and March.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:50</strong></p>
<p>And she indeed is from our Plane! A lot of this fits perfectly</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 20:51</strong></p>
<p>She’s friends with Caleb so I’m not surprised. I wonder how long she’s been in on this</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:51</strong></p>
<p>But Janet has worked here for the last eight years…</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:52</strong></p>
<p>Shes's been making videos here for over 10 years, so she was here first. She was recruited, and moved up the ranks</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 20:53</strong></p>
<p>How long has the other researchers like Hyles and March been working for UMAD?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:53</strong></p>
<p>She was recruited directly into her position by the Headmaster himself.&nbsp; Before that we are told she fought in the revolution on the side of Rameus.&nbsp; It was her efforts with the intelligence team organized by Samuel that led to a number of victories for the revolutionaries.</p>
<p>Their names have only shown up recently.</p>
<p>March has been working here for at least a year though.</p>
<p>Maybe longer?</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 20:55</strong></p>
<p>What about Freeman?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:56</strong></p>
<p>About the same time?</p>
<p>It's hard to say without their files.</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 20:57</strong></p>
<p>So Janet is well established in your world, but the others are recent entities with no known history, atleast on records you can access....</p>
<p>How old was umad as an organization again?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:58</strong></p>
<p>Eight years but it took two years to construct our facilities.</p>
<p>This land used to be filled with goblins.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:59</strong></p>
<p>So Janet's been there since the beginning. Yet she was already living a double-life here.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:59</strong></p>
<p>Out of need for work and the promise of education Dial built up around the tower quickly.</p>
<p>It's uncertain.&nbsp; So much isn't clear yet.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 21:01</strong></p>
<p>Wait... I just had a thought. Time works differently between our worlds. Would a Year in your plane be the same length as ours?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 21:01</strong></p>
<p>If we investigate Culture maybe we will get more information on Hyles involvement.&nbsp; Seems more important now that we know about Janet.&nbsp; Unless we are certain we want to investigate Planar.&nbsp; If you find anyone else you want to share with me maybe I can confirm something for you?</p>
<p>I suppose you could do the math on it.&nbsp; From what I've read they seem pretty close.</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 21:02</strong></p>
<p>Culture and planar definitely seem to be the top two deptartments of interest right now. With the newest revelation it may be better to go culture. What do you guys think?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 21:02</strong></p>
<p>I wish I had a higher clearance.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 21:03</strong></p>
<p>Ok, I think we should move to Culture. It might give me some info going into my chat with him later this month</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 21:03</strong></p>
<p>Hey youve already done a lot, peach. We will get there. Itll just take time</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 21:03</strong></p>
<p>I agree, we can continue this train of developments to find more on Hyles and then we can move to Planar to see if there's any more information about the next mission</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 21:04</strong></p>
<p>I agree with Culture, especially since Shades has his interview coming up</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 21:04</strong></p>
<p>Is there any way for us to bypass the Clearance Checks. Hacking, as we call it, to get to that info?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 21:04</strong></p>
<p>I'm going to check the recent scripts and grab the quill.&nbsp; Should only take a few ticks.</p>
<p>Hacking?&nbsp; The bureaucracy of UMAD is a beautiful and terrible thing.&nbsp; It's both a strength and a weakness for them.&nbsp; If I could get clearance documents I could easily just walk through infernal affairs and grab documents.&nbsp; If I have the papers I could even pass myself as the Headmaster.</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 21:06</strong></p>
<p>If they use air elementals to send messages I wonder how possible it would be to intercept and 'hack' one. Or maybe 'program' it to deliver the message to the intended recipient and us/peach as well? Not sure if an elemental can be made a contruct type entity like an undead.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 21:06</strong></p>
<p>Trouble is, they know a fake pretty easily.&nbsp; I'd need the real deal.</p>
<p>We could use the new encryption to make messages for counter intelligence…</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 21:07</strong></p>
<p>You're thinking a Misinformation campaign?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 21:08</strong></p>
<p>Only if necessary.</p>
<p>Just another weapon in our arsenal.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 21:08</strong></p>
<p>Agreed.</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 21:08</strong></p>
<p>Solid option</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 21:08</strong></p>
<p>Anyways, grabbing those docs and the quill.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 21:09</strong></p>
<p>Anything helps</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 21:13</strong></p>
<p>Back</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 21:14</strong></p>
<p>Welcome back</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 21:14</strong></p>
<p>Lot's to sift through</p>
<p>I had a thought, if Cami is Janet then she would be missing from her desk when Cami needs to be visible wouldn't she?</p>
<p>Any way to determine that?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 21:15</strong></p>
<p>Oh My God, you're Right! She does Live Broadcasts from time to time, so we'll look out for that.</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 21:16</strong></p>
<p>Doesn't cami do live streams? We should reach out next time one is on going and see if Janet is still at her desk</p>
<p>Nvm shades beat me to it</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 21:17</strong></p>
<p>Just let me know when she does.&nbsp; If I'm available then I can probably run off to her desk.&nbsp; I live on site afterall.</p>
<p>There is a lot of foxtrot in these scripts.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 21:19</strong></p>
<p>What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 21:21</strong></p>
<p>Foxtrot is yet another encryption.&nbsp; Responses to it are to not be made in foxtrot.&nbsp; All foxtrot messages are receipt only.&nbsp; It's a clearance level 14 encryption.&nbsp; Those who Need to Know the script know it but do not write in it.&nbsp; It was also designed by the Headmaster but during his time as the Headmaster.</p>
<p>Basically only the Headmaster and the Assistant Headmaster use it.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 21:23</strong></p>
<p>Guess we got some work to do. If it's Encrypted, we can try to break it. Hopefully it doesn't require a Keycode</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 21:23</strong></p>
<p>It uses a numeric code with dozens of digits to the character.</p>
<p>Keycode?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 21:23</strong></p>
<p>Nevermind, that won't apply in this case</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 21:24</strong></p>
<p>Some Ciphers need a Keyword to crack</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 21:24</strong></p>
<p>So like the homophonic cipher from earlier but incredibly long?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 21:24</strong></p>
<p>Maybe?&nbsp; It's said he had to create the math for it.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 21:25</strong></p>
<p>I mean, if you could get the equation that might help. If there is one.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 21:26</strong></p>
<p>Foxtrot also has strange pitch.&nbsp; Pitch is something used to mask transverse wave patterns.&nbsp; Pitch isn't utilized often as it requires very advanced aetherial constructs to use and the time it takes to send a message this way is very slow.</p>
<p>Yet Janet has at least four messages in foxtrot just today.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 21:28</strong></p>
<p>Janet should at least in theory have some grasp on how to crack it then, right? She reports to the assistant Headmaster after all</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 21:31</strong></p>
<p>Of course, it wouldn't make sense to send her information in this way otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 21:34</strong></p>
<p>If so then the key to the foxtrot messages might be in Janet's desk, there's no way a single human (as far as we know) could memorise the key to a cipher that involves dozen of digits for a single alphabetical character. She might keep the key close to hand</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 21:34</strong></p>
<p>Oh god. So even more difficult than the one you already sent with custom made math.... im scared guys lol</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 21:35</strong></p>
<p>That makes sense...&nbsp; We just need the key to the Cipher.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 21:36</strong></p>
<p>I'd Say next time she streams, if she indeed isn't at her desk, see if you can find it and make a copy. Stealing it outright would lead to trouble, but a copy of it would be a BIG help</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 21:37</strong></p>
<p>Alternatively we could let it go and focus on listening to the other departments and looking into getting clearance for personelle files and learn about Project Grindstone.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 21:38</strong></p>
<p>Oh we can still do that, but if an opportunity presents itself, we shouldn't pass it up. But we'll hold off for now till that happens</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 21:39</strong></p>
<p>I'm going to set this quill up at Culture before I sift through the rest of these messages.&nbsp; Also... I haven't eaten today.&nbsp; I'll be back later.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 21:40</strong></p>
<p>You go eat and research, we'll do the same. Great job team!</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 21:43</strong></p>
<p>Things just get more and more real</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 23:07</strong></p>
<p>Back</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 23:08</strong></p>
<p>Ok, so what do we got?</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 23:08</strong></p>
<p>Welcome back</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 23:08</strong></p>
<p>Besides indigestion from mess' experiment?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 23:09</strong></p>
<p>Wait what?</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 23:09</strong></p>
<p>Oh no were you working with Pauchik?</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 23:09</strong></p>
<p>I assume he means mess as in mess hall?</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 23:10</strong></p>
<p>Lol</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 23:11</strong></p>
<p>Hyles, March, and Freeman are all planning to start a second round of recruitment shortly after the second mission is released.&nbsp; Admin is trying to finalize a few increased security measures before they release the next mission.&nbsp; It seems I'm the reason why your onboarding was delayed.&nbsp; They do also intend to be more aggressive with the application process to speed things along.&nbsp; I wouldn't be surprised if you finish mission three by end of month.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 23:12</strong></p>
<p>That's promising</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 23:12</strong></p>
<p>UMAD will then close recruitment again and reward participants yet again with one, two, or three invitations.&nbsp; They will then monitor the influx of applicants to gauge potential personnel loyalty.</p>
<p>Three invitations to be provided to those who have succeeded at the previous mission as well as this one.</p>
<p>SC isn't the only party of interest at the Whimsy, so is CO.</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 23:14</strong></p>
<p>Okay so we need to really play in to the 'need to know' theme of secrecy and privacy to get in their good books.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 23:15</strong></p>
<p>Wait, who is CO? That's a new one.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 23:15</strong></p>
<p>They rigged the recruitment so that invitations can extend beyond what they tell you to recruit.&nbsp; If possible I'd invite what you are given, no more and no less.</p>
<p>Not sure.&nbsp; Apparently Marino meets with CO at the Whimsy as well.&nbsp; Seems to know a thing or two about Alchemy.</p>
<p>On my way back here I snagged docs from culture.&nbsp; Haven't looked at them yet.&nbsp; There is only two transcripts though so it's significantly less than Janet's information.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 23:18</strong></p>
<p>Oooh those should help. Hopefully more info on some of the researchers</p>

<p>SC seems to also be somewhere in the discord.</p>
<p>They are organizing a meeting to talk about their continued involvement.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 23:19</strong></p>
<p>None of the names match up, so SC must be thier Real Initials. We'll need more info to ID them.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 23:20</strong></p>
<p>I got more details on technology they use.&nbsp; Not much different from Janet's as far as I can tell but I'm no expert in this.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 23:21</strong></p>
<p>Not surprising, Most Singers and Streamers use similar Tech. I even us an AT2020 Microphone myself.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 23:22</strong></p>
<p>Alright, to the Culture documents...</p>
<p>It looks like Researcher Hyles is a field researcher and is actually part of the Culture Department!</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 23:24</strong></p>
<p>At this rate, I may HAVE to go into Culture, since it's lining up. Hell, they called me a Cultural Expert already</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 23:24</strong></p>
<p>This means he is on an active culture research project.&nbsp; I suspect if I go digging in the active projects he won't be there.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 23:25</strong></p>
<p>Is SC male or female?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 23:25</strong></p>
<p>The pronoun used is he when referring to SC</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 23:25</strong></p>
<p>okay thank you</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 23:26</strong></p>
<p>Anything you can tell us about SC's general background?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 23:26</strong></p>
<p>Not much, just that they seem to know about your recording technology, meet with culture often, and hang around the whimsy a lot.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 23:27</strong></p>
<p>If we sent a picture would you be able to show your operative?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 23:28</strong></p>
<p>If you send a picture I might be able to ID someone.&nbsp; Aside from you all, I'm alone.</p>

<p><strong>Peach — Today at 23:29</strong></p>
<p>Who is this?</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 23:29</strong></p>
<p>Sean Collins, I'm looking through the researcher's Twitter and seeing who they follow and hoepfully finding out who SC is from there.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 23:30</strong></p>
<p>Do you have an older image or one without anything obstructing the face?&nbsp; I'm not a very visual person...nor very good at making out voices.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 23:31</strong></p>
<p>Thing is, he will likely always be wearing that accessory. Those are Glasses, which he uses to help with vision issues.</p>
<p>So any image of him will have that on his face</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 23:32</strong></p>
<p>I understand.&nbsp; I've never seen those, I'm sorry.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 23:32</strong></p>
<p>No need to apologize. If you don't know, you don't know. It's why we're here to fill you in</p>
<p>+</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 23:33</strong></p>
<p>Did you want me to still try this tactic or will it be too much trouble for you?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 23:33</strong></p>
<p>It's no trouble for me.&nbsp; If I recognize someone I'll let you know immediately.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 23:33</strong></p>
<p>Okay cool</p>

<p><strong>Peach — Today at 23:34</strong></p>
<p>No...&nbsp; They don't look familiar</p>
<p>Apparently SC also knows Researcher Freeman very well.</p>

<p><strong>Peach — Today at 23:39</strong></p>
<p>I've seen that man at the Whimsy!\</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 23:39</strong></p>
<p>BINGO!</p>
<p>There's your SC</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 23:40</strong></p>
<p>It would be a very good coincidence.&nbsp; The initials match.</p>
<p>I just assumed he was blue banner..&nbsp; He helped set up for one of their performances.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 23:41</strong></p>
<p>But he's not in the Discord. I know his Username: SonicMega, but they're not in here.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 23:42</strong></p>
<p>Hmmm...&nbsp; Maybe they set up another account?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 23:42</strong></p>
<p>Wait... I know what they use for their Twitter Profile Picture, and it's similar to someone in the Server: Volnutt</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 23:43</strong></p>
<p>Yep and Volnutt's profile links to the sonicmega twitch account, so it's pretty safe to say it's Sean Chiplock</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 23:43</strong></p>
<p>And That's the Game!</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 23:44</strong></p>
<p>More and more va's and singers.... all researchers or umad staff. Hmm</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Yesterday at 23:44</strong></p>
<p>Now to continue down this path, we need to ID who CO is. Do we know if they're He or She?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 23:44</strong></p>
<p>It makes sense with culture's involvement.</p>
<p>He and they are apparently also within the chat...</p>
<p>That's it for my notes so far.&nbsp; We can wait on more culture or switch it up.&nbsp; In the meantime I wonder what else I can be doing?</p>
<p>I guess my actual job might be a good start.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Yesterday at 23:48</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, Gotta keep up appearances</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Yesterday at 23:48</strong></p>
<p>Yeah that might be beneficial for appearances lol</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 23:49</strong></p>
<p>I've never been the best at being on time.&nbsp; Maybe NOT doing my job is keeping up with appearances.</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Yesterday at 23:50</strong></p>
<p>Still curious what your job is, exactly.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 23:51</strong></p>
<p>I'm a researcher.&nbsp; The specifics aren't important.&nbsp; Maybe when this is all over we can talk more about it.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Yesterday at 23:57</strong></p>
<p>It would be good to know you a little better, especially with all the info we've been forced to share. But Of course, we know you can't tell us too much, but anything you could revel would help us trust you more.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 23:59</strong></p>
<p>You have to understand, any information I put out there could come back to hurt me.&nbsp; UMAD has lots of resources at their disposal.&nbsp; I trust you now but what happens when they start to offer you opportunity or resources yourself?&nbsp; When does altruism no longer work as a motivator?</p>
<h2>6th August 2021</h2>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 00:01</strong></p>
<p>Fair enough. Can't be too careful. Maybe as time goes on, it might become neccesary, but we'll bench that for now</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:02</strong></p>
<p>I appreciate that...&nbsp; I'll tell you what though, if I find a way to make this beneficial for you maybe I will have that security.&nbsp; It's just a thought.</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 00:05</strong></p>
<p>Fair enough. I look forward to the day we can know more about you, and not just your world</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 00:06</strong></p>
<p>I know this is a stupid longshot but every CO I find in the researcher's following I'm posting so here's Conan O'Brien</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:244px;"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/HHopGggfVZPrfVNgqomLg5pfStvjoUFTF0RnDdabM0DFQBlHnDFLtgZ6DVT5YPQqV3EpX0eTtoMI6LdOTFP7oxUsg3QyRunlqDtyA-6s2zl-H0HjyqZRyhpmudzUcLVhz_K4FY9G"></figure>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:07</strong></p>
<p>Shades, you said you interview people?&nbsp; You have a connection with Researcher Hyles who is an entertainer in your world?</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 00:08</strong></p>
<p>….</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 00:08</strong></p>
<p>Not Directly. I've recorded a few of his Concerts and done streams of them with him, but not much beyond that.</p>
<p>Same goes with many of those I've interviewed.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:08</strong></p>
<p>I've read the name but likely only a coincidence.&nbsp; I've never seen this man and I have never heard of a researcher by that name.</p>
<p>Something wrong Brandon?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 00:09</strong></p>
<p>We kind of figured, but had to check</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 00:09</strong></p>
<p>Just processing all of this</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:10</strong></p>
<p>Why do you interview them?&nbsp; Why do you record them?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 00:11</strong></p>
<p>It's all for Entertainment. The People I interview are entertainers, and we like to get to know them better. Same with the Concerts. We want to share their musical performances with others, cause they do some amazing work.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:12</strong></p>
<p>We?</p>
<p>You do this to entertain yourself?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 00:12</strong></p>
<p>Myself, and anyone who watches my Content. I have Fans, people who enjoy my work, as well as fans of the Entertainer, so they can enjoy it as well</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:13</strong></p>
<p>You make these visual transmissions like what you send me with Cami-Cat?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 00:15</strong></p>
<p>Yep! I normally Review Anime, a type of Animation made in the Country of Japan. Those are usually the kind of entertainers I interview; those who voice characters in that kind of media. many of the Researches make covers, or Recreations of Music from these Anime.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:15</strong></p>
<p>You also interviewed this Matpat?&nbsp; Is Matpat part of anime?</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 00:16</strong></p>
<p>Matpat is a giant name in the internet world</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 00:16</strong></p>
<p>He covers Video Games, another type of entertainment. He and I did used to work together many years ago, but I haven't talked with him for a long time now.</p>
<p>He's a bit of a researcher in his own right, as he looks at the story and science of different games, and tries to fill in the gaps with his own theories. His channel is actually called "The Game Theorists"</p>
<p>btw, here's a sample of my work. So you can see what I do: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZCgpDOUOZg"><u>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZCgpDOUOZg</u></a></p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 00:24</strong></p>
<p>Oh lord Madoka Magica:fearful:</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 00:34</strong></p>
<p>Also, We might have identified another person. The user Daxel is almost certainly the brother of Researcher Hyles.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 00:34</strong></p>
<p>....</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:35</strong></p>
<p>This is what you do theshades?&nbsp; I wasn't aware Researcher Hyles had a brother.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 00:36</strong></p>
<p>...Yes. Caleb has an older brother</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 00:36</strong></p>
<p>He does, and he has a wife, who's in the server as well, under Pumpkin_Ice</p>
<p>And yes, those kind of videos are the main thing I do.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:38</strong></p>
<p>I suppose I know little about the researcher's personal lives...&nbsp; I spend so much time at work and doing this I guess I don't socialize too much.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 00:38</strong></p>
<p>Fair enough</p>
<p>I'm not even sure Daxel is involved to be honest. He could be just be here to support his brother. Though I have no idea. Anything is possible</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 00:41</strong></p>
<p>Most likely both of them are. But we should still make note, so we can be careful around them</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 00:42</strong></p>
<p>They don't interact a whole lot on discord so I doubt you have much to worry about</p>

<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 00:47</strong></p>
<p>Who's that?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:48</strong></p>
<p>I'm not familiar with this person either</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 00:48</strong></p>
<p>I'm looking for CO male names, I'm looking through March's twitter for who she follows right now</p>
<p>I'm looking through all of them</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 01:01</strong></p>
<p>Ok, I think we need more info to figure out CO. I've check every person in this server, and none of them have anything that could help us Identify them, We've even checked the other Researchers' Twitter Friends, and found nothing that fits. We're gonna need more before we can ID him</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 01:01</strong></p>
<p>I suppose he prefers anonymity</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:05</strong></p>
<p>I could always explore the whimsy sometime.&nbsp; It's very difficult to get food but drinks are decently priced there.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 01:05</strong></p>
<p>Oooh do they have coffee?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:07</strong></p>
<p>Orzzo.&nbsp; It's a little difficult to get coffee this far North.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 01:07</strong></p>
<p>Orzzo?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:08</strong></p>
<p>Plus now that the boarder radicals have been more active the cost in a nightmare.&nbsp; Most of it supplied by boat.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 01:08</strong></p>
<p>Must not be as easy to produce as it is here. We have Coffee all over the place here.</p>
<p>ahhh... That explains it</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:09</strong></p>
<p>Sounds nice.&nbsp; Back in the days of Othello I had the fortune of living near a lord down near Paint.&nbsp; I used to be able to smell it during noon.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 01:09</strong></p>
<p>That sounds pleasant</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 01:10</strong></p>
<p>Maybe if you ever came to our plane, you could try some of the Interesting ways we serve coffee. It's not just straight Black here.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:10</strong></p>
<p>Orzzo isn't so bad though.&nbsp; Not to mention most people are suspicious of coffee.</p>
<p>&nbsp;don't think I understand what you mean by different ways to serve it?</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 01:11</strong></p>
<p>I prefer a chilled flavored variant of coffee myself</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:11</strong></p>
<p>Orzzo is a drink maid from Barley</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 01:11</strong></p>
<p>Let's just say we've found many ways to drink coffee. I'd be here all day if I tried to explain them</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:11</strong></p>
<p>According to the google tool your people have it as well.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 01:11</strong></p>
<p>I presume we call it beer here</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:12</strong></p>
<p>Chilled?&nbsp; I think something is lost in communication.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 01:12</strong></p>
<p>What is Coffee to you guys</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:12</strong></p>
<p>We have beer too.&nbsp; This is very different.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 01:12</strong></p>
<p>That means I like my coffee cold</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 01:12</strong></p>
<p>Ah I see</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 01:12</strong></p>
<p>Instead of hot like is traditional</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:12</strong></p>
<p>Use the google.&nbsp; You'll see</p>
<p>You let the coffee go stale?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 01:13</strong></p>
<p>No, we put ice and stuff. We even found a way to brew it cold.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 01:13</strong></p>
<p>Well there are malt drinks, and whiskey</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:13</strong></p>
<p>My preferred beverage is a good milk stout.&nbsp; It keeps you healthy.</p>
<p>You can afford an elemental?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 01:14</strong></p>
<p>We have Machines that can do it. I told you before, we don't have magic here</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:14</strong></p>
<p>Elementals aren't aetherial.</p>
<p>You say you don't have magic then mention a construct with thermokentic spellcraft in programming...</p>
<p>Thermokinetic</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 01:16</strong></p>
<p>We have Science. It can seem like Magic, but it's all Physical reactions and things like that.</p>
<p>Peach — Today at 01:16</p>
<p>Unless it's alchemical?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 01:16</strong></p>
<p>It's silmilar to Alchemy, just not as mystical</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:16</strong></p>
<p>That's very familiar to me.&nbsp; Belthidian law.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 01:16</strong></p>
<p>Belthidian?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:17</strong></p>
<p>All phenomena are mystical.&nbsp; Why else would we do toristic experimentation to find answers?</p>
<p>Yes...not to be confused with Belthean…</p>
<p>In hindsight not a very good name for a country if you ask me.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 01:17</strong></p>
<p>I see. For us, the opposite is true: All phenomenon can be explained, so nothing is mystical here.</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 01:18</strong></p>
<p>Belthidian law is akin to our laws of physics if im remembering a prior convo correctly</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 01:18</strong></p>
<p>We can break down to the smallest particles how something works</p>
<p>.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:18</strong></p>
<p>All phenomena?&nbsp; And&nbsp; you have such explanations?&nbsp; We believe that anything can be explained but this requires dedicated research and toristic practices.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 01:19</strong></p>
<p>And we have people whose whole career is that kind of dedicated research. We call them Scientists</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:20</strong></p>
<p>I've used the google tool to look at science.&nbsp; Give me a moment.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 01:20</strong></p>
<p>...This could take a while</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 01:21</strong></p>
<p>Lol</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 01:21</strong></p>
<p>I wonder if toristic practice is similar in thought&nbsp; to the aristolian method? Like maybe Tor was the name of some big scholar there or something?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:21</strong></p>
<p>The scientific method looks like Torism to me</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 01:22</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, that's all we have. We don't have any kind of mysticism, though there are some who claim they do, but nothing believable. Pretty much scams and parlor tricks.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:23</strong></p>
<p>Tor is in fact a a brilliant scholar</p>
<p>I don't think our practices are all too different</p>
<p>Here at UMAD we have a wealth of resources to practice the toristic approach to study which is founded in logic.&nbsp; This seems to be nearly identical to your scientific method.</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 01:24</strong></p>
<p>It sounds like the 'practice' of research follows similar methods in both planes but where they have elementals and aetherial components we have.... well everything in our natural world</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:25</strong></p>
<p>I've always personally hated the world natural.&nbsp; If all things can be explained the connotation concerns me as to an unnatural.&nbsp; Afterall everything was created by Belthid according to their laws.</p>
<p>Although I've always find it strange we credit that to Belthid if there are so many gods presiding over all domains and a few just as old as Belthid.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 01:27</strong></p>
<p>Sounds more like Religious Preaching than anything. We have Religions that preach similar things, how our World was created by a Single God.</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 01:27</strong></p>
<p>Or several depending on which faith one follows, if they follow one at all</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:28</strong></p>
<p>There are those who don't find gods enigmatic but actually just the most simple of systems.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 01:28</strong></p>
<p>I've only started reacquinting myself with faith recently</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 01:28</strong></p>
<p>And many of them tell you that if something cannot be explained, you should "Just Believe". It'd be silly, if it didn't lead to some dangerous results</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:29</strong></p>
<p>It sounds like your faiths are very Hellshian in nature.&nbsp; I for one disagree with this and prefer the temples that encourage you to become more familiar with your god through questioning.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 01:29</strong></p>
<p>In our world Peach, we would refer to such individuals as "Atheists"</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 01:29</strong></p>
<p>I wish we had more like this in our world. Might make our world a better place.</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 01:29</strong></p>
<p>Your world seems to have a unified stance on what deities exist(in so much as youve described them), even if practices and sects differ. Ours is more faith based. Our science has yet to show evidence of any sort of deity. And if one exists they haven't exactly announced themselves clearly.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 01:29</strong></p>
<p>Intriguing. Though I have found that the particular approach depends on the individual</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:29</strong></p>
<p>I'm familiar with atheism.</p>
<p>Maybe our concept of god differs greatly too and that is an unknown miscommunication</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 01:31</strong></p>
<p>Perhaps. Theres much we dont understand of each others worlds yet</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 01:32</strong></p>
<p>Connor Colquhoun. Not CO initials, but he's someone that's showed up multiple times and has it in both names</p>

<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:33</strong></p>
<p>I appreciate your dedication but still not someone I recognize.</p>
<p>I think it's about time to grab some more of the documents.</p>
<p>Off to Culture I go.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 01:34</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, I'm blind diving here lol</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:54</strong></p>
<p>Back</p>
<p>A few more pages</p>
<p>It seems they get roughly a tenth of the messages Janet does</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 01:55</strong></p>
<p>Oof She's been withholding a lot</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 01:55</strong></p>
<p>Still, hopefully we got something good here</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 01:59</strong></p>
<p>Looking through it all now.</p>
<p>"Baiting was successful.&nbsp; Our current research on social media suggest not only levels of efficiency in reach of prospective candidates but several recent information leaks as well as free public information on the most intimate aspects of the extra-planar lives.&nbsp; I suggest beginning a threat level assessment.&nbsp; We will start at a level of individual candidates to be determined by Meer Soot's method of random selection.&nbsp; Following this a planar level assessment. We will need an increase of candidates and so I suggest utilization of current applicants and campaigning for recruitment with current staff.&nbsp; Failing this more forceful techniques may need be implicated.&nbsp; Given current readiness, candidate status, and the need for more engagement and applicants I suggest initiating the next stage of the application within an interval's time.&nbsp; Will stand by to confirm this timeline."</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 02:06</strong></p>
<p>Interesting</p>
<p>This would seem to confirm that they intend to start recruiting again</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:08</strong></p>
<p>So that's their outer plan. They tested to see if Social Media would help with recruitment, so now they plan to double their efforts with us involved, picking a few random candidates to help out. If that doesn't work, they have other methods that we won't like. But this means they're making their move now.</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 02:13</strong></p>
<p>I see the mad genius was involved too. Even more reason to go engineering</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:14</strong></p>
<p>They mention a Researcher Hanford in these documents.&nbsp; They work for Alchemy it seems and are one of your people.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:16</strong></p>
<p>Hanford. Does this guy look like him:</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:229px;"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/WEFHq21lEay2jW2Iaq03UypnA_gLAPwLNqeyzcgXtgWygubAG77ocJ0Px5TYO1wD09UhWoD9q3yOb4GAF88U6EGOcg_zAuIJn3Hvzjz7imrnqgS9fDuZXD5cM1U1CVReJXxelvQq"></figure>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:16</strong></p>
<p>Hanford seems to have the pronoun she</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:16</strong></p>
<p>Well, Damn</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:17</strong></p>
<p>There is also a Mann and Khan mentioned but they don't seem to be researchers.&nbsp; It seems they are your kind assisting as consultants.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 02:18</strong></p>
<p>Hmm I haven't a clue who these could be</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:19</strong></p>
<p>Same. There's quite a few people with that name, so this will take some digging.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:19</strong></p>
<p>I don't think this the surface we are scratching but by no means everything.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 02:19</strong></p>
<p>And how do we know these names aren't codenames or nicknames?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:20</strong></p>
<p>We don't</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:20</strong></p>
<p>To be honest, though, the fact all the others we've learned have been their real names, so I'd stick to that line of thinking for now</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:21</strong></p>
<p>That's why I don't think we are hardly close to the larger secrets of this project</p>
<p>They bothered with some security but didn't even really try at hiding names.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 02:22</strong></p>
<p>Not all Shades. Cami wasn't operating under her real name remember?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:23</strong></p>
<p>That's an Exception, since she was Janet all along, and even then her Real name of Camille came up</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 02:24</strong></p>
<p>Any more background on researcher Hanford? Any way she might be connected to Hyles or the others we have already confirmed?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:25</strong></p>
<p>Also, what are the Pronouns for Mann and Khan? Need to narrow down our search</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:25</strong></p>
<p>No connection that I know of.&nbsp; She works in Alchemy or with alchemy and that's all I really know.</p>
<p>No pronouns were used for them</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:26</strong></p>
<p>So we're blind, still. This could be tricky</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:28</strong></p>
<p>We didn't get this far in one interval.&nbsp; It'll take time.&nbsp; We just have to get ahead of whatever UMAD is planning.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:29</strong></p>
<p>Fair, but we will need to move quickly, given they'll be making their next move very soon</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 02:32</strong></p>
<p>They said within an interval so this should be interesting</p>
<p>Also weird hearing Meer Soot's name come up again, head of engineering and mad-scientist-type. If they're using the method of random selection used by him then that just seems to point more towards the idea that they're gathering more people to experiment with, just like we already know about with them mentioning Shades.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:32</strong></p>
<p>Maybe I should look into the whimsy some more while we are waiting on more documents form Culture.&nbsp; Or maybe there is something else I can do?</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 02:32</strong></p>
<p>Maybe they'll ask Shades recruit people from his fanbase</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 02:33</strong></p>
<p>I agree, we need a bit more information on CO before we can pin them down after all</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:33</strong></p>
<p>In that case maybe we should promote more recruits in the meantime.&nbsp; It beats anything they might do...forcefully</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:33</strong></p>
<p>So you want us to bring more people in here?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:34</strong></p>
<p>That would imply I HAVE a Fanbase. I'm less than 1000 subs atm</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:34</strong></p>
<p>Subs?</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 02:34</strong></p>
<p>Hey! Even a small fanbase is still a fanbase</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 02:34</strong></p>
<p>Peach, i definitely think hanging around the whimsey is good. Never know what youll find.</p>
<p>Subs means subscribers. People that have tuned in to the broadcast enough to seek to be notified on the next broadcasts release</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 02:35</strong></p>
<p>It's a number by which YouTubers judge their worth. It's actually kinda become rather pointless in recent times</p>
<p>I like Butchers explanation better tbh</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:36</strong></p>
<p>Broadcast?</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 02:36</strong></p>
<p>Things like the video Shades shared earlier</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 02:36</strong></p>
<p>What about Planar, didn't we need more info on the mission?</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 02:36</strong></p>
<p>I was avoiding video, thought broadcast would make more sense... the next performance might be a good word</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 02:37</strong></p>
<p>I thought we opted to focus on cultural with the janet/cami-cat revelation</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:37</strong></p>
<p>Hear me out on this...&nbsp; What if TheShades mentioned the project to his subs?&nbsp; He can't recruit but if he made himself valuable to UMAD or at least APPEAR to be useful to UMAD they might cool down their investigation of him as a cultural expert.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:38</strong></p>
<p>Guess I got a Video to make now.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:38</strong></p>
<p>I don't know how difficult these performances are.</p>
<p>It wouldn't be too terribly time consuming and expensive would it?</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 02:39</strong></p>
<p>Depends on the type of performer. It can be. But i dont know shades process</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 02:39</strong></p>
<p>Depends on the performance:sweat_smile:</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:39</strong></p>
<p>Nah. Shouldn't take long at all. Should I wait till they ask, or just make one as soon as possible?</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 02:39</strong></p>
<p>We got more names to research from it and I think it's crucial to know more about this AR tool that they're going to use.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:40</strong></p>
<p>I think as soon as possible is best.&nbsp; Don't wait for them to ask.&nbsp; On one hand you appear to be recruiting, on the other you give additional attention they weren't expecting.&nbsp; That unexpected variable is the kind of thing that could have them call off the hounds as it were so they can wait and watch.</p>
<p>Should I move the quill from Culture or let it go through the night?</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 02:42</strong></p>
<p>I worry if you move the quill too often itll draw suspension.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:43</strong></p>
<p>Maybe...&nbsp; Moving it or leaving it can both be risky.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 02:43</strong></p>
<p>Maybe. Although Snow does raise a good point about needing more info on Planar</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:43</strong></p>
<p>It should go without saying to not compromise this side of things in your broadcast.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 02:44</strong></p>
<p>Simply put, I don't think we want to be caught to off guard by the next objective</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 02:44</strong></p>
<p>Either culture or planar is fine for me honestly, I just wanted to point out. I'm heading off for a little bit for a family dinner, brb later</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:44</strong></p>
<p>Brb?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:45</strong></p>
<p>Be Right Back</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 02:45</strong></p>
<p>Fair... we can leave it over night in Planar to learn more before the next letter from umad, then after its dropped go back to cultural?</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 02:45</strong></p>
<p>Sorry, short for 'be right back'</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:45</strong></p>
<p>Understood.&nbsp; Enjoy.</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 02:46</strong></p>
<p>We use a form of shorthand in text communications in informal settings. Though maybe we should see this as a formal one given your focus on etiquette and professionalism.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:47</strong></p>
<p>Ok, so I made a Script for the Video I plan to make, but let me run it by you guys:</p>
<p>Hey guys, Shades here.</p>
<p>So Recently I've been participating in something called Project Grindstone. I'm not exactly sure as to what it's about, but It seems to be a Research project, where we need to solve Ciphers to progress. What I do know is that plenty of Musicians and Voice Actors are involved, such as Caleb Hyles, Cami-Cat, AnnaPantsu, Lizzie Freeman, aka LizzieBiz, and Sean Chiplock, among many others.</p>
<p>But we're gonna need all the help we can get to solve these ciphers. So if you're interested in helping out, head over to projectgrindstone.net and sign up. If the first mission is any indication, things are about to get very interesting, so you don't wanna miss out.</p>
<p>So sign up today, and then join the Discord Server, so you can be ready for the next mission.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 02:48</strong></p>
<p>I like that. One thing though</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 02:48</strong></p>
<p>Wow that was fast.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 02:48</strong></p>
<p>I wouldn't mention Cami or Sean. Especially neither have actually been confirmed</p>
<p>That might send up a flag no?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:48</strong></p>
<p>Brandon has a point.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:49</strong></p>
<p>Cami's in the Server, and anyone who knows sean's twitch channel will recognize it. I should be fine.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 02:49</strong></p>
<p>If you're sure then. I trust your judgement</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:50</strong></p>
<p>I'll add the line "or at the very least are participating as well" to make it less obvious</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:50</strong></p>
<p>If you say so.&nbsp; At the very least I can now know what they are talking about between departments.&nbsp; I think we should have at least a majority of you guys agree though.</p>
<p>Butcher?&nbsp; Chuck?</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 02:51</strong></p>
<p>Butcher seems to be offline</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:51</strong></p>
<p>He's often Invisible, meaning he can be online, but appear offline.</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 02:53</strong></p>
<p>Sorry, sidetracked. Trying to multitask.&nbsp; Hmm. I see merit to both sides. I definitely think the plausible deniability of 'are participating' helps. If you are going to mention cami-janet and sean then work that line in for sure</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 02:54</strong></p>
<p>I think the script is good Shades, I don't think the extra names should be a problem since Cami has joined and Sean's twitch is pretty recognisable, it can be argued to be just discord insider information if we end up getting questions about it.</p>
<p>Given that UMAD has said the next stages of recruitment could be within the next interval, I say we go for Planar since it means we can get insight into what those stages are, with my second choice being going for Cultural so that overall we've spread ourselves across multiple departments and we can see what they might be saying to each other.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:55</strong></p>
<p>Alright, I'll get to work. I'll easily have something ready before long. Might even be done tonight, and release it tomorrow</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:56</strong></p>
<p>I'll move the quill to Planar then and see what the night provides.&nbsp; Meanwhile I'll go for drinks at the Whimsy.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 02:57</strong></p>
<p>Have fun, let us know if you see anyone we should know about</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 02:57</strong></p>
<p>Have a pleasant evening Peach</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:57</strong></p>
<p>Same to you.</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 02:57</strong></p>
<p>Take care, stay safe</p>
<p>What was it you said? May your walls be salted?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 02:58</strong></p>
<p>Yes, and floors damp.</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 02:58</strong></p>
<p>You'll have to explain that sometime.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 03:56</strong></p>
<p>It is done. The Video will release tomorrow Morning, hopefully beating UMAD to the punch with their next step</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 15:00</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8g1yiWoHXk"><u>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8g1yiWoHXk</u></a></p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 15:02</strong></p>
<p>It looks great! Good job! Hopefully this will bring more applicants in like UMAD wanted.</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 15:49</strong></p>
<p>'Only 2 channels' 'no idea what doublelock is' ugghh i hate feigning ignorance lol</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 15:50</strong></p>
<p>Right? It's so hard to keep hush about what we know. But it'll pay off in the end</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 15:50</strong></p>
<p>For sure</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 15:51</strong></p>
<p>Ikr it's really annoying but it's what we have to do</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 15:52</strong></p>
<p>One step at a time</p>
<p>Now to see if umad smacks them for unauthorized posting i guess</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 15:53</strong></p>
<p>I have a small idea btw, I think the title for the updates channel might be the tree that appears everywhere on the website</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 15:54</strong></p>
<p>Hmm maybe. I can kinda see it</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 15:57</strong></p>
<p>Speaking of, Peach whenever you see this can you tell us if you have any idea what that tree might be? It's gotten us creeped out before and it appears everywhere, even in the profile picture of UMAD-MANAGEMENT</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 17:27</strong></p>
<p>Hello everyone!</p>
<p><strong>Sir Gruffles — Today at 17:27</strong></p>
<p>Good morning!</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 17:27</strong></p>
<p>Morning</p>
<p>Well, Afternoon for me</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 17:27</strong></p>
<p>Hrm...&nbsp; It looks like a tree from a weird.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 17:28</strong></p>
<p>Good evening, how was your night at the Whimsy?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 17:28</strong></p>
<p>There are so many weirds though.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 17:28</strong></p>
<p>What's a weird?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 17:29</strong></p>
<p>Not going to lie, I think I had a little too much to drink.&nbsp; The performance was.. unavoidable.&nbsp; They came off the stage and tried to pull patrons on the stage.&nbsp; I was one of only about eight there.&nbsp; Refusal was met with actors just staring at you.&nbsp; It was uncomfortable.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 17:30</strong></p>
<p>Oof... Yeah, that can happen here too. Still, were you able to see anyone there of interest?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 17:31</strong></p>
<p>A weird is a wooded area that is..weird?&nbsp; I don't know how else to describe it.&nbsp; Weirds can have extra planar influence, they could have a wooded blight, they could have a large population of undead.&nbsp; There are several things that can make a weird.&nbsp; Hell there is a weird where several trees have painted stories.</p>
<p>Weirds are best to be avoided.&nbsp; There are people in culture who are experts on them however.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 17:32</strong></p>
<p>Ok, I can get the gist from that. It's a Forest that has been warped, mostly by Planar Influence.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 17:33</strong></p>
<p>Not necessarily, but it can be.</p>
<p>I saw that Chiplock character again.&nbsp; Came in pretty late.&nbsp; Said he was tired from the stream.&nbsp; I want to investigate where the Stream might be but I haven't found anything in reference so I was going to look into it using the google tool soon.&nbsp; He seemed very familiar with the Blue Banner though, that and they actually ignored him.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 17:38</strong></p>
<p>I can help. He was likely doing a Live Broadcast, which is called a Stream, since we stream the video across the network. Let me check something</p>
<p>Sure enough, he did run a stream last night. He was live for close to Four Hours, which can easily wear someone out like that</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 17:40</strong></p>
<p>Later he hopped the bar and picked something up from the kitchen.&nbsp; A small box with nothing distinguishing about it.&nbsp; A few people were griping that he was getting food from the kitchen.&nbsp; Now everyone thinks you get served only if you're a regular.</p>
<p>An actor tried to take it but he just gave a sharp look and said "Whose your favorite playwriter" and then they just froze there.</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 17:42</strong></p>
<p>Huh, thats weird.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 17:43</strong></p>
<p>There was likely a pickup. Safe to assume it wasn't Food in that box</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 17:43</strong></p>
<p>Uh guys, derpasherpa just got all ominous in general</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 17:44</strong></p>
<p>I just saw that.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 17:45</strong></p>
<p>Artifacts of aetherial programming can have artifacts to their artifacts.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 17:45</strong></p>
<p>Update on Hyles: I just heard back, and he's confrimed our meetup on the 24th. It's happening for sure now.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 17:46</strong></p>
<p>When was that sent?</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 17:46</strong></p>
<p>Awesome Shades! That’ll be a good time</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 17:47</strong></p>
<p>If youre refering to derpa, minutes ago</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 17:47</strong></p>
<p>If you mean Hyles, it was less than 20 Mins ago</p>
<p>But I suggest we keep an eye on our E-mails and DMs. Somethings coming soon</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 17:48</strong></p>
<p>For sure. Peach have you had a chance to check the quill?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 17:48</strong></p>
<p>Oh!&nbsp; Also got a look into the kitchen, didn't see the chef but I saw another guy there.</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 17:49</strong></p>
<p>Oh?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 17:49</strong></p>
<p>Not yet, I think I'll grab it then some Orzo.</p>
<p>They look familiar.</p>
<p>Looked like one of your kind but I don't remember where I've seen them.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 17:50</strong></p>
<p>Any features about them stand out?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 17:52</strong></p>
<p>Short curly brown hair and a goatee?&nbsp; pronounced freckle on the left cheek?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 17:53</strong></p>
<p>We'd need to know which of the Agents it was, then we could narrow our search better. That Freckle will be a Massive clue once we do, however</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 17:53</strong></p>
<p>Hang on</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 17:53</strong></p>
<p>You got an idea?</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 17:54</strong></p>
<p>Yea I was browsing through general last night. I completely spaced on a thing I found though, I was so tired.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 17:55</strong></p>
<p>?</p>

<p><strong>Peach — Today at 17:55</strong></p>

<p>Boom!</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 17:56</strong></p>
<p>YES! Good one, Butcher!</p>
<p>HE was on the list of possible candidates, but I ruled him out for some reason. Bad Call on my part</p>

<p>Exciting.&nbsp; I'm going to have a celebratory wake up drink.&nbsp; Maybe Kadmin will start loving me again soon.</p>

<p>The big red ball in the sky?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 17:58</strong></p>
<p>Oh, so your version of what we call a Sun</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 17:58</strong></p>
<p>Your equivalent of what we call a Sun I take it?</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 17:58</strong></p>
<p>Or as I lovingly refer to it as: the cursed day moon</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 17:58</strong></p>
<p>Although if it’s red…hmm</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 17:58</strong></p>
<p>Does Sun hate inebriates too?</p>
<p>I like that, Kadmin is most certainly a day moon.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 17:59</strong></p>
<p>Um our Sun is not discriminate</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 17:59</strong></p>
<p>The sun isnt a living entity but people suffering from a hangover certainly find it abrasive</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 17:59</strong></p>
<p>It's just a Large ball of GAsses in Space</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 17:59</strong></p>
<p>I believe my humor was lost.&nbsp; I'm going to drink away the drinking pain from last night with Orzo.&nbsp; I'll be back.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 18:00</strong></p>
<p>Drinking pain, or as we call it: a Hangover</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:54</strong></p>
<p>Got some paper and some Orzo.</p>
<p>Now to look through these.</p>
<p>I went to Culture at first because I forgot it was moved to Planar.&nbsp; Sorry that took so long.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 18:56</strong></p>
<p>No worries</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:59</strong></p>
<p>Looks like mission two is being divided up into two sections.&nbsp; Some of the researchers plan to be more active an interval following the release of the next mission.</p>
<p>The exploratory tool they are using is being filtered through a medium you have in your world.&nbsp; They are using something called minecraft.&nbsp; This allows for safe and effective exploration while shielding the reality of their planar exploration through a game element.&nbsp; It's a minor but effective form of deception.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 19:02</strong></p>
<p>Lol Minecraft huh</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 19:03</strong></p>
<p>Huh. Well, if there was any game to use, thatd be one of the better ones based on popularity…</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 19:04</strong></p>
<p>Good thing I got that then. This should be interesting</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 19:04</strong></p>
<p>This is not their only intended medium.&nbsp; I myself know how to set up these tools but I don't have the proper equipment.&nbsp; Should extra planar exploration be necessary in the future but safely.</p>
<p><strong>Sir Gruffles — Today at 19:05</strong></p>
<p>Oh jeez, Minecraft? I think I have that medium...but never actually interacted with it…</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 19:06</strong></p>
<p>I never actually bought minecraft... I'll see about buying it. Or maybe I'll borrow a friends account lol</p>
<p><strong>Sir Gruffles — Today at 19:11</strong></p>
<p>Let's wait and see what the other medium is. I am not the biggest fan of the Minecraft plane, and would greatly appreciate a different Plane lol</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 19:12</strong></p>
<p>It looks like you'll be collecting characters to find the solution to this next mission.&nbsp; I think it is their intention to find how much collaboration and organization is possible as a secondary result of the application process.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 19:12</strong></p>
<p>I can use minecraft fairly decently, I'm interested in seeing what else they'll be using</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 19:12</strong></p>
<p>If need be, I can help guide us through. I'm pretty versed in Minecraft. Was just playing it myself a bit ago.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 19:13</strong></p>
<p>What kind of characters?</p>
<p><strong>Sir Gruffles — Today at 19:13</strong></p>
<p>I'm updating my equipment to launch into that plane.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 19:14</strong></p>
<p>It just says characters.</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 19:14</strong></p>
<p>We should probably collab outside of the minecraft plane so its not obvious we already work together</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 19:15</strong></p>
<p>I wouldn't worry, odds are they know we've at least talked already. We should be fine</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 19:15</strong></p>
<p>"Planar exploration will be delayed to phase three, for the applicants part two of mission two, to properly clean residual undesired elements."</p>
<p><strong>Sir Gruffles — Today at 19:16</strong></p>
<p>Wow. Undesired because I don't like Minecraft? I'm insulted!</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 19:16</strong></p>
<p>They must need to setup the plane. Might want to explain what Minecraft is for Peach. I'm in my car now, or I'd do it myself</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 19:16</strong></p>
<p>Guess I'm getting washed away later....lol</p>
<p><strong>Sir Gruffles — Today at 19:17</strong></p>
<p>I'm assuming the first part will be the recruitment drive, followed by a cipher?</p>
<p>And that Cipher might lead to the Minecraft world seed?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 19:18</strong></p>
<p>Or a link to a map dowload</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 19:18</strong></p>
<p>I'm not certain.&nbsp; When they are discussing undesired elements it usually means they are trying to hide something.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 19:19</strong></p>
<p>Using a minecraft server would mean people may be able to sabotage each other. I know they want us to be competitive but I doubt they want us at each other's virtual throats</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 19:22</strong></p>
<p>Likely not yet..&nbsp; I wouldn't put it past them.&nbsp; They might be stress testing your interpersonal relationships at some point if not now.</p>
<p>Minecraft isn't a plane of exploration but a tool by which to mask the plane being explored.&nbsp; I don't know enough about minecraft to say why they would select this tool as a medium.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 19:23</strong></p>
<p>Good luck with that. My relationships are my business</p>
<p>We'll just have to wait and see what happens</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 19:24</strong></p>
<p>I mean of course the interpersonal relationships of those involved in the application process and those assisting the applicants.</p>
<p><strong>Sir Gruffles — Today at 19:24</strong></p>
<p>Interesting. Well, as soon as my internet stops being a butt, I can update my connections to that tool's systems.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 19:25</strong></p>
<p>Still going through the planar notes.&nbsp; Seems like a lot happened last night.&nbsp; I just hope I can get through everything before I'm expected to work today.</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 19:26</strong></p>
<p>Wow looks like moving the quill was the right call</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 19:35</strong></p>
<p>Lots of arguing about deadlines.&nbsp; Planar seems pretty disorganized but that makes sense.&nbsp; What doesn't make sense to me is there shouldn't be anyone these messages are going to.</p>
<p>Someone seems active in the department head office though...</p>
<p>Looks like they are actively investigating a couple of the people on the discord however.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 19:40</strong></p>
<p>Any clues as to who?</p>
<p>The ones being investigated, I mean</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 19:43</strong></p>
<p>Well, based on the previous communications we've uncovered...it seems pretty clear that they are likely looking into Shades</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 19:48</strong></p>
<p>He isn't wrong about the shades but there are others.</p>
<p>I think it's safe to say that these people are not researchers.</p>
<p>Tanyatheshydragoness, Argent, AnimusCustodius, GayBird, Kenzie Mayne, and Pumpkin Ice.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 19:51</strong></p>
<p>They've all been relatively active, Pumpkin Ice has not but she is researcher Hyles' wife</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 19:51</strong></p>
<p>Why would they be looking into Kara?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 19:52</strong></p>
<p>Leslie is also mentioned but they mention disappointment.&nbsp; I believe it is related to them sharing the information.</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 19:52</strong></p>
<p>Im not sure if its good or bad that the rest of us arent on the list of people of interest</p>
<p>We want to make waves and be impressive but not draw too much attention. Such a tightrope</p>
<p><strong>Sir Gruffles — Today at 19:52</strong></p>
<p>I'm almost saddened that I'm not a person of interest.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 19:53</strong></p>
<p>It might be worth noting that Kenzie's bio reads "voice actress"</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 19:54</strong></p>
<p>Hmmm another one.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 19:55</strong></p>
<p>They can only look into so many and who knows their criteria.&nbsp; It would make sense that Hyle's wife is being looked at if he is a recent addition to UMAD although recent is a relative term.&nbsp; Due to limited resources Culture might only recently be using Planar to do proper security checks.</p>
<p>Chuck seems to be a favorite and The Shades seems to be someone they want to abduct last we checked.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 19:56</strong></p>
<p>Yeah well I don't think Kara is up to anything. As I said, she's not really active on discord anyway</p>
<p>Really? They like Chuck huh?</p>
<p>Oh right UMAD messaged him. But they also messaged Snow didn't they? Hmm</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 19:58</strong></p>
<p>Ah, I forgot about Snow being reached out to.</p>
<p>It's almost like they are looking into as many people as they can.&nbsp; It can only happen so fast though.</p>
<p>Their own application system is working against them though as they have to proceed.&nbsp; Also we are working pretty fast ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 20:00</strong></p>
<p>True</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:01</strong></p>
<p>A moment, my research project team leader needs to talk.&nbsp; Probably more busy work…</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:55</strong></p>
<p>Ok, Finally back home. I'm still confused as to how I got their attention. I'm not that well known or popular, yet they want me specifically. While I appreciated finally being noticed, I don't quite want any attention that will lead to trouble.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 20:56</strong></p>
<p>Well, you're the cameraman for Metrocon. And you have been talking about how you plan to interview Caleb. Which I may add, this wouldn't be the first time</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:57</strong></p>
<p>I guess maybe he mentioned me, especially since I just met up with him at Metrocon, so it'd be fresh in his mind. Still, never expected it would lead to this.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 20:58</strong></p>
<p>It is what it is</p>
<p>Caleb aside, you also have been pretty active in regards to the cyphers. I mean you figured out the monk thing. That's impressive</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 22:51</strong></p>
<p>Work, work, work</p>
<p>I'm back</p>
<p>Performance review and another stack of things to do.&nbsp; No sleep tonight.</p>
<p>I have some big news though.&nbsp; Planar docs suggest a means to request the proper clearance paperwork.&nbsp; I think we might stand a chance to create a new clearance doc as long it's during a transition of power within the Planar department.&nbsp; One is coming up but I don't think we have any real time to use it.&nbsp; Also they would be able to find a redundancy which would put UMAD on a higher alert.&nbsp; If we want access to personnel files we should careful plan when we do it.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 22:59</strong></p>
<p>We're gonna have to think on this. We need to know what the best time would be, but with how random things seems to be in that department, we might not have a clear timeframe.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 23:21</strong></p>
<p>Understandable.</p>
<p>Planes signaled Infernal Affairs to call some people who previous contacted them.&nbsp; UMAD is waiting for either late tonight or the first to address this in chat to announce the next mission.</p>
<p>Planes seems to be having a number of messages coming from Alchemy at this time.&nbsp; Necromancy seems to have lightened up quite a bit on security probably due to increased work load on your admissions.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 23:32</strong></p>
<p>Is there anything else from Planar that we would need to know at this time? Honestly, knowing Minecraft is the next part of the test is a HUGE help. We'll know where to concentrate on. I'm thinking that it's going to be constructs or devices or something on your side that we'll be controlling and moving around in your world while to us it's a game.</p>
<p>Btw I'm back from work so I'm ready to help!</p>
<p>And if that is the case, we may be able to actually meet up with you Peach.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 23:44</strong></p>
<p>Maybe, I have a theory I'd like to apply to transmit a virtual awareness but I'm not sure what medium will work.&nbsp; I'll need to find a plane that has been previously explored by UMAD that is designated safe but also no longer permitting active travel.&nbsp; That way I can find a compatible medium to explore there and we won't be interrupted by UMAD.&nbsp; I would need more equipment to do that as well though.</p>
<p>I'm still skimming the planar notes but I need to keep up with my other work to avoid losing my position here.&nbsp; I might have to leave again soon.&nbsp; It looks though that the next mission has help from Culture and Planar but is nearly entirely designed by Necromancy.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 23:49</strong></p>
<p>Makes sense. Necromancy could make the world in Minecraft, but Planar and Culture could setup the cipher for them to add to it.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 23:49</strong></p>
<p>Makes sense. Necromancy could make the world in Minecraft, but Planar and Culture could setup the cipher for them to add to it.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 23:51</strong></p>
<p>Damnit...&nbsp; I have more work.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Yesterday at 23:51</strong></p>
<p>Have fun…</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 23:51</strong></p>
<p>Cataloging materials... again…</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Yesterday at 23:58</strong></p>
<p>So We just dug around the Grindstone Website, and Realized there's an image that might worth knowing about. Is this a city from your realm?</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:496px;"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/LZydspdFdtzuKzgZYNT5xPX8GM0IJXlgSv5w3KY4f7SdFOieOIW7T2UQVib0C8EmrHqDjCH_k8MX6Y2TaHMCsW62z2dL3y9hu2fx09qSdafoYO0gClF1Lg6_WTK_MsGAF0FzR-nr"></figure>
<h2>7th August 2021</h2>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:01</strong></p>
<p>I might have to ask around culture.&nbsp; I'm geographically challenged.</p>
<p>Although...&nbsp; I don't know who I could ask.</p>
<p>Maybe I should look into reference?&nbsp; That sounds like a long night though.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 00:02</strong></p>
<p>Well, if it helps, the name of the image mentions the name Obelus City.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:02</strong></p>
<p>Ohh.....&nbsp; I know of Obelus.</p>
<p>Well I know of it.&nbsp; I can probably get something drudged up on it pretty quickly.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 00:03</strong></p>
<p>There's also an Obelus Kiln?</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:433px;"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/hBOiLGznhFD4nONuDBv4cR4wwh33zQetHiZlYDBtDjB-GId-Bev_Es8HB_XMmqY-Weye4WDbWoO29nqLiTL9GL-Yfr2e4N-uQDEmzhypyG9I1cLaw_ThE4Xtyl0poLJDHJ3jscpo"></figure>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 00:03</strong></p>
<p>If they're using this image on the website, clearly there's a significance, so anything you can learn will help.</p>
<p>They may even attempt to recreate this city for the Minecraft Mission, so this could be helpful</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 00:03</strong></p>
<p>Funeral Kiln for cremation.&nbsp; Pretty common.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 00:04</strong></p>
<p>Oh. So that thing is a mortuary. Good to know</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 02:21</strong></p>
<p>'I honestly forgot about the phone number. Umad seems to be very specific on what they do and dont want us to collaborate on though, if the earlier test link is anything to go by. If you think theres something we need to know maybe message someone through dm's until we know more one what is and isnt ok to share?'</p>
<p>In regards to Bombadil's message to me. And reminding me i was supposed to mention that we should limit public messaging on certain topics. Thoughts on my phrasing? @Peach ?</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 02:35</strong></p>
<p>Careful @TheShades , make sure you can defend the name drops without info from this side.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 02:36</strong></p>
<p>I got that covered. Don't worry</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 02:38</strong></p>
<p>Solid</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 03:03</strong></p>
<p>Hey Peach do any of these places seem familiar? They're on the Terms and Conditions, Privacy Policy, and FAQ's section of the website respectively</p>
<p>Mines</p>

<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 03:58</strong></p>
<p>Hey Peach, does the term 'Lamented Liens' mean anything?</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 03:59</strong></p>
<p>Or the initials KF?</p>
<p>Janet sent out the 2nd mission. We got really excited and took the too obvious answer as our first guess, then took a closer look and realize we misstepped... Probably getting our files docked for both being wrong and answering when asked to wait but... we will fix it.</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 04:23</strong></p>
<p>Hows this for a cryptic hint/warning?</p>
<p>'After the incident with Leslie im not sure how good it is to freely share information, if umad is quick to ax links they send once theyre made known. But I will say its important to inspect things closely. Dont stop at surface level.'</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 04:24</strong></p>
<p>Wait where did you get that?</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 04:27</strong></p>
<p>He wrote it</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 04:27</strong></p>
<p>Thats what im thinking of sending in general</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 04:27</strong></p>
<p>ah ok</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 04:28</strong></p>
<p>To both hint at insepcting elements and to not be too quick to message general with answers and random umad links</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 15:47</strong></p>
<p>I see I came back to quite a bit.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 15:47</strong></p>
<p>Sorry, we found quite a bit</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 15:47</strong></p>
<p>After the new mission dropped, we really started digging around.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 15:48</strong></p>
<p>So what should I address first?</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 15:48</strong></p>
<p>I mean I guess go from the first one and go down to make it easiest.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 15:49</strong></p>
<p>Did Butcher send that message out?</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 15:49</strong></p>
<p>No people found the code before he sent it out so there's no need.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 15:50</strong></p>
<p>Though we are wondering if we should look into bringing in more members here as a backup. We've seen a few potential candidates in this new crop of people, and We can already clear a few as safe</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 15:51</strong></p>
<p>Those just look like some mines to me.&nbsp; I've never seen that house but Seawell is a coastal town in the far South East of my country.&nbsp; It's a loop point.&nbsp; The Othello Wall was the name of the wall protecting the capital city before the revolution.&nbsp; After it was heavily damaged parts of it were rebuilt and the exploited weaknesses saw fortification.&nbsp; Now it's the Rameus wall.</p>
<p>Lamented Liens is a company within Dial actually.&nbsp; Rental constructs and secured loans from what I recall.&nbsp; Although I've never personally been there so maybe I'm mistaken?</p>
<p>I'd absolutely encourage more people on here.&nbsp; If we only have one to each department the lack of redundancy might be dangerous.&nbsp; What if one of us is found or is unable to perform?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 15:56</strong></p>
<p>Ok, then I offer a Suggestion: When they contact you, don't translate for them. We need to test them to make sure they're ready for what's to come.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 15:56</strong></p>
<p>I agree</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 15:58</strong></p>
<p>I suppose I can do that.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 15:58</strong></p>
<p>Alright, was there anything you found from the Quill in Planar?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 15:58</strong></p>
<p>Alright, I'll reach out to some potentials and see what we can get.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 15:59</strong></p>
<p>Haven't checked it yet.&nbsp; The boss had me working until Kadmin rose.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 15:59</strong></p>
<p>Oh my you haven't had any sleep then huh?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 15:59</strong></p>
<p>I have...&nbsp; a little.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 16:00</strong></p>
<p>Well get that Orzo then lol you'll probably need it</p>
<p>If you haven't drank a ton already</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 16:02</strong></p>
<p>I was just thinking of grabbing some.&nbsp; Apparently rats got into the Barley though so I'll need to go to the Whimsy to get some.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 16:02</strong></p>
<p>Awwwwww</p>
<p>That really sucks</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 16:03</strong></p>
<p>It's not a far walk but everything feels far when you're tired.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 16:03</strong></p>
<p>I feel that</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 16:03</strong></p>
<p>I blame alchemy for the rat problem</p>
<p>Transmogrification potions for heightened fluid and crystalized intelligence.&nbsp; Exciting idea but not very efficient to test on rats if you ask me.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 16:05</strong></p>
<p>Testing on Rats. Not to far removed to what our Scientists do here</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 16:05</strong></p>
<p>And the first the thing they thought was 'TO THE BARLEY!' haha</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 16:06</strong></p>
<p>Barley is healthy stuff.</p>
<p>Anyways, to the Orzo!</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:01</strong></p>
<p>Back</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 18:01</strong></p>
<p>Welcome back</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:01</strong></p>
<p>More planar notes</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 18:01</strong></p>
<p>What we got?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:03</strong></p>
<p>First of all I think I have everything I need to get a clearance doc made but as I mentioned before we need to plan it around the incoming and outgoing department heads.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 18:04</strong></p>
<p>I guess we have to hear news of one leaving before we can make a move</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:04</strong></p>
<p>Second, I found the previous head of Planar is to be pronounced deceased soon.&nbsp; It doesn't seem like there is a clear cause of death however.&nbsp; At least none UMAD has listed, or should I say decided on.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 18:05</strong></p>
<p>I'm assuming the real reason wasn't Accidental, then</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 18:05</strong></p>
<p>Oh no, Genevieve didn't make it. Maybe she was she was getting close to something she shouldn't.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:05</strong></p>
<p>Some of these transcripts suggest determining an irregular cause of death that doesn't warrant investigation.</p>
<p>The Planar department goes through a lot of department heads.&nbsp; It happens almost weekly.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 18:06</strong></p>
<p>The Planar department is dangerous after all so it's to be expected</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:06</strong></p>
<p>The curious thing about this one is the next head has a very high clearance and the death of the previous was fabricated.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 18:07</strong></p>
<p>So she's still alive?</p>
<p>Or cause of death fabricated?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:07</strong></p>
<p>It could be as simple as she passed due to something they couldn't disclose or maybe she isn't dead?</p>
<p>It's unclear.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 18:08</strong></p>
<p>Interesting</p>
<p>What else did you find?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:09</strong></p>
<p>Well, Hanford came up again in communication.&nbsp; I attempted to check the personnel files and yet again it's missing from my clearance level.</p>
<p>Found a few notes on how they intend to utilize the technology for extra planar exploration during your mission.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 18:11</strong></p>
<p>Oh that'll be helpful!</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:12</strong></p>
<p>Also I've found the five dimensional spatial coordinates of the plane.&nbsp; I cross referenced this and came up with little.&nbsp; I did learn that it was a place of active exploration only a season ago but get this, it was inter-departmental as well.</p>
<p>The plane had similar but not exact Belthidian laws to ours.&nbsp; It limited aetherial pull among other things.</p>
<p>Flora and fauna records were redacted.&nbsp; I found a note about first communication meaning there must be intelligent life there however.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 18:15</strong></p>
<p>Wait... Do you have the Coordinates? That description might be from our Realm. From past talks, it sounds like either our World, or a Minecraft World.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:15</strong></p>
<p>They likely chose the plane because it was safe and the Belthidian Laws well understood.</p>
<p>How do realms usually look?&nbsp; These coordinates explain space and spatial movement.&nbsp; It's a 5 value system with variable characters attached for estimated movement in the fluid mosaic.</p>
<p>I also have a reference on Obelus.&nbsp; This wasn't part of the quill discoveries, just something I picked up.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 18:19</strong></p>
<p>From the Whimsy or work gossip?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 18:19</strong></p>
<p>Fluid Mosaic? If it's the same as how our world describes it, that involves Cell Membranes. That's on a microscopic level</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:20</strong></p>
<p>From reference, it's a leather-bound with notes on various cities and nations.</p>
<p>The fluid mosaic describes the planar reality.&nbsp; It takes two models to describe the universe with one existing as a disc-like fluid mosaic of planes occupying space within the aetherial matrix.&nbsp; As the aetherial matrix moves the newly created space is filled by the stretching of these planes within 5 dimensional space.&nbsp; The second model is biconical in nature and is an expression of rate-time.&nbsp; The center of the biconical structure shrinks infinitesimally and at it's central point exists space outside of time.&nbsp; This is where it is said Doublelock resides.&nbsp; As objects move away from the center time passes slower in relation to the center.</p>
<p>We call relative space within the disc rings.&nbsp; By convention we call all things at the same relative distance from the center as us but on this side of the biconical structure "ring one"</p>
<p>The center is "ring eight" and therefore where time passes at our rate but on the opposing side of the biconical structure would be "ring fifteen"</p>
<p>your world and mine are both ring one.&nbsp; So is this plane being observed through the minecraft medium.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 18:28</strong></p>
<p>It could be possible, though it might be on a closer ring, since times moves realtively fast in Minecraft. But for us to access a Minecraft world, we either jump into one at Random, or use what's called a "Seed", a series of Numbers that would best be described as Coordinates to a particular Plane in Minecraft, or at least a recreation of it.</p>
<p>Here's what a Seed Number looks like: 2151901553968352745</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:30</strong></p>
<p>That string doesn't have assisting values to denote variables.&nbsp; I don't think the planar coordinates are the same as a seed.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 18:30</strong></p>
<p>Worth a Shot, at least. It might be something else, but we don't have a clue where to look</p>
<p>Most of our coordinates only work on a Three Dimensional axis. We don't have a way to access beyond that</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 18:31</strong></p>
<p>Btw what was described about Obelus?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:40</strong></p>
<p>What would you like to know about Obelus?</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 18:41</strong></p>
<p>What's that tower with the ball on it?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:42</strong></p>
<p>1.1987-611/1.8386+6/1.2238-11/1.9882-664/1.7677+232</p>
<p>Those are the planar coordinates</p>
<p>The ball?&nbsp; Let me check.</p>
<p>You're probably talking about what this book describes as a false moon.&nbsp; A small artificial landmass set adrift above by a combination of aetherial and iasadic methods and used for iasadic veneration for the Moon Patron.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 18:45</strong></p>
<p>Iasadic?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:46</strong></p>
<p>A topic I'd prefer not to get into…</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 18:46</strong></p>
<p>And to be clear this is what I was talking about.</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:100px;"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/fvlQVXmKbkVOkNfupj9h3X8RrYbVAOsimxQ5Yivo_qAPuDsxNg3QCKES6IPa0g3TbbUjBL82rvtjmJgFbsIRyxXUS3W2z0PzN5IvD90IajODNJR4uwTuNNFZgyRgRChbwm4UWP1l"></figure>
<p>Okay that's fine</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:47</strong></p>
<p>That looks like the structure, yes.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 18:47</strong></p>
<p>That's weird though because that picture is what's used for the icon for the Project Grindstone website.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:52</strong></p>
<p>I'm not certain why.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 18:54</strong></p>
<p>Also, to help you get an idea of what they may be up to with Minecraft, it would help if you saw that world as we see it. I took the Coordinates you gave and calculated them into a single number. It was long enough to use as a Seed Number, so I opened up Minecraft, and opened a new world using the Seed. This is where I ended up:</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:358px;"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/gwhos18Kr_1qPRnpuuZkrer-QiCfJg08d3TqksAgO90c06zxXntkVL9EOu3lSP_EcUYRWt2ZeI43loptno_u4SRXzisL5uno7XhbHfN6wMKdqRWWKR7IXFCo7a777qFT5PbflBRN"></figure>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 18:58</strong></p>
<p>This looks very strange to me.&nbsp; What does it look like on your side?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 18:59</strong></p>
<p>That's it. We don't actually go to the plane. For us, Minecraft is but a game, where we explore this world, and build using the materials around us. This is what it looks like to us.</p>
<p>It's all in Cubed Shaped Objects</p>
<p>Btw, a new person named Megaranger should be contacting you soon. Be ready to test him.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 19:26</strong></p>
<p>Peach, question if I may. Have you ever heard of "Domme Geiten"?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 19:29</strong></p>
<p>I'm not, but it sounds like an Oudste settlement.</p>
<p>They tend to have strange names like that.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 19:30</strong></p>
<p>Indeed. Appearently they have an abundance of goats</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 19:33</strong></p>
<p>Should we move the quill to necromancy or do you think we need to learn more from planar?</p>
<p>What does everyone think?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 19:39</strong></p>
<p>We need to know more about what is planned for the next stage. I'm down</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 19:39</strong></p>
<p>I'm good with that. Provided it doesn't put Peach in trouble</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 19:40</strong></p>
<p>Well between alchemy and necromancy, necro has less security</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 19:41</strong></p>
<p>If you move to Necromancy it'll likely need to be soon but remember that they have the best security.&nbsp; There security has recently lightened up due to the demands for your application process.&nbsp; There is also aetherial studies and alchemy.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 19:43</strong></p>
<p>Okay so necromancy is designing the the next test, while alchemy and atheriel studies are coordinating it, right?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 19:45</strong></p>
<p>They are on the project but as necessary.&nbsp; Planar and Necromancy are doing most of the heavy lifting right now and it seems Culture is always active likely due to the people from your side working on the project.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 19:46</strong></p>
<p>Hmm</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 19:51</strong></p>
<p>You said their security had lightened up due to our application process? Then I say move it. This is our best chance to get info on Necromancy. They'll likely tighten back up once the second phase of recruitment passes</p>
<p>Which would mean increased risk if we wait to do this</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 19:52</strong></p>
<p>Yeah now would probably be the best opportunity if we want anything from that department.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 19:52</strong></p>
<p>Do we have any thoughts on additions to the team?&nbsp; Maybe having an extra person per department would be good to keep redundancy in the event someone is compromised.&nbsp; I don't think anymore is really necessary unless we just want them to bounce ideas off of.&nbsp; Though if someone exceptional comes our way then we should extend the offer.</p>
<p>So move the quill to necromancy?</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 19:53</strong></p>
<p>Please</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 19:53</strong></p>
<p>Agreed on both statements</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 19:53</strong></p>
<p>As for new people, I trust Shades judgement on that</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 19:53</strong></p>
<p>Having teams of two will definitely help increase our chances of finding info as well</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 19:54</strong></p>
<p>I've already sent someone your way. They're from my own community, so I can easily confirm they're safe to bring in if they can pass the test</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 19:54</strong></p>
<p>You have two more missions after the current one and then you're in.&nbsp; Best get the team together before then.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 19:55</strong></p>
<p>Understood</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 19:55</strong></p>
<p>I haven't heard from them yet but I'll hopefully hear soon.&nbsp; I will need to continue inventory today so I will be gone for several parts however, I will move the quill at that time too.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 19:56</strong></p>
<p>Be safe Peach</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 19:56</strong></p>
<p>Okay you do your best Peach</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 19:56</strong></p>
<p>Will do and thank you for your help so far.</p>
<p>Looks like they reached out.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:00</strong></p>
<p>I'm talking with them now myself. I've given them the code hint so send them an untranslated message, and see if they can get it</p>
<p><strong>Sir Gruffles — Today at 20:28</strong></p>
<p>I'm late, but also good with moving quill to necromancy.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 20:48</strong></p>
<p>I agree too, especially since necromancy is involved in making the next mission</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 20:49</strong></p>
<p>Another contacted me.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Today at 20:52</strong></p>
<p>I have found another potential recruit. They go by the name Eris</p>
<p>So be on the lookout Peach. Remember, don't translate please. We gotta test them</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 20:53</strong></p>
<p>I think they got it covered</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 21:01</strong></p>
<p>Welcome Eris</p>
<p>Lots to catch up on I'm sure.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 21:02</strong></p>
<p>We're filling her in now.</p>
<p>Also, Megaranger should have responded to you</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 21:02</strong></p>
<p>Yes and I asked them if they would keep the information here private.&nbsp; I haven't heard anything since.</p>
<p><strong>Eris — Today at 21:04</strong></p>
<p>Hi!&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’ll spend some time looking through the messages, but I’ll make sure to learn as much as I can</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 21:04</strong></p>
<p>I'm sending two more people to you Peach, both of them I live with and I know fairly decently, they should be trustworthy</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 21:05</strong></p>
<p>Are they aware that everything must remain confidential?</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 21:05</strong></p>
<p>Yes they are</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 21:05</strong></p>
<p>With them and ranger that would make 10 people.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 21:05</strong></p>
<p>I'm working on one more, but they haven't responded to me yet. Might have to look elsewhere.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 21:06</strong></p>
<p>Two more and we can divide our numbers between all the departments with redundancy.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 21:06</strong></p>
<p>Snow is talking with another</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 21:09</strong></p>
<p>I'll be back.&nbsp; I'm grabbing Orzo.</p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman — Today at 21:33</strong></p>
<p>I'm heading into work soon so I'm going silent until late.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 21:47</strong></p>
<p>Back</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 21:47</strong></p>
<p>We got some new Candidates sent your way</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 21:47</strong></p>
<p>Goodness, lots of people reaching out.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 21:47</strong></p>
<p>We've been busy</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 21:54</strong></p>
<p>Ranger should be in soon.</p>
<p>Waiting on the others to respond to me.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 21:54</strong></p>
<p>Welcome Megaranger! Glad you made it</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 21:55</strong></p>
<p>Welcome.</p>
<p>I suppose if this amounts to twelve people helping then we should decide departments yet again.</p>
<p><strong>Sir Gruffles — Today at 21:59</strong></p>
<p>I'm still set with Planar, myself.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 21:59</strong></p>
<p>Cultural, since I have no choice</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Today at 21:59</strong></p>
<p>Still good with Alchemy</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 21:59</strong></p>
<p>Still want engineering</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 22:01</strong></p>
<p>Hi</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 22:02</strong></p>
<p>Adding nobody</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 22:10</strong></p>
<p>Congratulations Gruffles.</p>
<p>May only one eye of Caboumin grace the union.</p>
<p>Welcome Nobody</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Today at 22:14</strong></p>
<p>Hello!</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 22:14</strong></p>
<p>Welcome Friend!</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 22:15</strong></p>
<p>I'm sure the others are filling you in.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 22:16</strong></p>
<p>We are</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 22:17</strong></p>
<p>Still waiting on Zella</p>
<p>They would make 10.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 22:18</strong></p>
<p>We're helping them through as we speak</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 22:19</strong></p>
<p>Can you explain that phrase, peach?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 22:19</strong></p>
<p>?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 22:21</strong></p>
<p>I think he's asking about: "May only one eye of Caboumin grace the union."</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 22:21</strong></p>
<p>^</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 22:21</strong></p>
<p>They are a god of love and hate.&nbsp; The implication is there is bountiful love that persists.</p>
<p>While one could assume the latter that has never colloquially been the spirit of the phrase.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 22:22</strong></p>
<p>So having only one Eye grace them would imply the couple receiving Love from them.</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Today at 22:23</strong></p>
<p>I like that we teach you our short hand slang and we learn your colloquialisms</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 22:23</strong></p>
<p>And expressing and expanding the domain of love.&nbsp; It's most holy in that regard.&nbsp; I'm wishing them the best.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 22:23</strong></p>
<p>I kind of assumed that, but still nice to learn more specifically what it meant</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 22:48</strong></p>
<p>Adding Zella momentarily.</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 22:50</strong></p>
<p>god that was long as hell</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 22:51</strong></p>
<p>?</p>
<p>I don't understand</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 22:52</strong></p>
<p>I think cause it has been a while since anyone talked in here.</p>
<p>ha ha</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 22:53</strong></p>
<p>no the transcript</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 22:53</strong></p>
<p>Oh! We've kept a Transcript of this chat, in case something happens, so we can check things later</p>
<p><strong>Eris — Today at 22:55</strong></p>
<p>Peach, could you please tell me more about the aetherial&nbsp; department?</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 22:55</strong></p>
<p>yeah by the way did you guy find out what "The Answer you seek is f, stay diligent, for more instructions will be coming" meant?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Today at 22:56</strong></p>
<p>I think that even tells us "This will be important later". I suspect the next part of the mission will reveal it's meaning</p>
<p><strong>megaranger467 — Today at 22:56</strong></p>
<p>K</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 23:01</strong></p>
<p>What would you like to know about them?&nbsp; Anything particular?</p>
<p><strong>Eris — Today at 23:02</strong></p>
<p>I’d like to get an idea about what exactly they do beside learning theory</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Today at 23:05</strong></p>
<p>Really it breaks down to the theory and practice of spellcraft.&nbsp; Understanding the aether in a more fine way.&nbsp; Collaborations with engineering lead to a better understanding of the Belthidian laws.&nbsp; After previous conversations and investigations on the google tool I would best describe them as inventors of new spells, students of what you call physics, and theorists of aetherial practice.</p>
<p><strong>Eris — Today at 23:08</strong></p>
<p>I guess I’ll try getting into this department then</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Yesterday at 23:22</strong></p>
<p>@Peach, Cami-Cat is streaming, could you attempt to raid Janet's desk?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Yesterday at 23:22</strong></p>
<p>@Peach JANET's LIVE! We have an Opening!</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Yesterday at 23:22</strong></p>
<p>Yes!!</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 23:23</strong></p>
<p>Really?&nbsp; I'll go now.</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Yesterday at 23:24</strong></p>
<p>Try to make a copy of the key to the clearance level 14 cipher if you can, that'll be really useful</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 23:34</strong></p>
<p>Not here long.&nbsp; A little winded but I went as fast as I could without drawing suspicion.&nbsp; She is in fact gone from her desk but there is an aetherial lock on one drawer and physical ones on most others not to mention aetherial eyes are patrolling.&nbsp; I got a solid look at things and it looks like both her in and out boxes are empty.&nbsp; I might be able to work around the eye's patrol but it's risky.&nbsp; Alternatively I can try to find something to dispel them or even the lock.&nbsp; UMAD will absolutely know if I do this however and I'll likely need to look around aetherial studies for something effective enough.&nbsp; As for the physical locks I might be able to pick some products up in alchemy to get an imprint of the lock.&nbsp; That'll allow me to get something made later and come back.&nbsp; Alchemy is near the bottom floor while Aetherial study is near the top however.&nbsp; I don't know how long Janet will be gone but I'll need to be smart about this.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon/Saber725 — Yesterday at 23:35</strong></p>
<p>Don’t take unnecessary risks Peach. You get caught and it’s game over</p>
<p><strong>SBButcher — Yesterday at 23:35</strong></p>
<p>If you are going to take a gamble, i feel the magical lock should have priority, so aetherial would get my vote. But as brandon said, its a high risk situation</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 23:37</strong></p>
<p>I'm not the most physically active so I don't know how subtle or stealthy I can be.&nbsp; If I do grab something to dispel UMAD will freak out.&nbsp; The safest thing I can think of is try to create an impression of the lock and try to open it next time but I'm not sure what to do about the eyes.</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Yesterday at 23:37</strong></p>
<p>the eyes?</p>
<p>magical locks are a no go for now i'd say: if they trigger an alert (and most definitely they do), you're very likely to be compromised</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 23:38</strong></p>
<p>Aetherial eyes.&nbsp; Moving aetherial constructs with limited material that give a one way visual of the surroundings to another caster.</p>
<p>Damnit</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Yesterday at 23:38</strong></p>
<p>impression of the physical lock has my vote; that is assuming she doesn't change the locks on a regular basis</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 23:39</strong></p>
<p>I'm also no expert on aeonization magic so I wouldn't know much of what I'm looking for to dispel these.</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Yesterday at 23:39</strong></p>
<p>I see, so they maintain constant surveillance</p>
<p>are the aetherial constructs placed everywhere within the institution, or just Janet's desk?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 23:39</strong></p>
<p>I guess I could suck it up and try to sneak it...</p>
<p>Several locations.&nbsp; Eyes are expensive to make and maintain though so they are limited.</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Yesterday at 23:42</strong></p>
<p>i see. could you feasibly disguise yourself, take a copy of the lock, then take off the disguise once you get back to where there are no eyes?</p>
<p>i'd assume seeing someone in a disguise could also be alerting though</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 23:43</strong></p>
<p>I'm also no expert on disguise...&nbsp; With that said I might have an option.</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Yesterday at 23:43</strong></p>
<p>Oh?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 23:46</strong></p>
<p>Selective transmogrification.&nbsp; I could go to the rat lab and take one.&nbsp; Although they might be wondering where the potion went.&nbsp; I suppose I could cause a small mess and maybe they would blame the rats.</p>

<p>i'm a bit unfamiliar with the term; would that turn you into an animal temporarily?</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Yesterday at 23:46</strong></p>
<p>Just be careful. This is a big gamble here, with no promise of payoff. If there's even a chance it's too risky, don't be afraid to back out.</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 23:47</strong></p>
<p>It would change me somehow.&nbsp; Hopefully they are clearly labeled.</p>
<p>Or maybe I should cause a distraction?</p>
<p>I understand but it's worth a shot.&nbsp; I just need a solid plan.</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Yesterday at 23:48</strong></p>
<p>Go for the Distraction. They'll be less likely to be on the lookout if they're in a bit of a panic</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Yesterday at 23:48</strong></p>
<p>how would you cause the distraction? can it be traced back to you?</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 23:49</strong></p>
<p>I could just let the rats out again.&nbsp; They are part of a higher intelligence experiment and we had trouble with them just recently.</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Yesterday at 23:49</strong></p>
<p>that could work</p>
<p>let the rats out, take a potion in the confusion</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Yesterday at 23:50</strong></p>
<p>That's honestly not a bad idea, the rats could work</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 23:50</strong></p>
<p>So let the rats out, get an impression, make a key later, wait for another opportunity, check the desk later?&nbsp; Any objections?</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Yesterday at 23:50</strong></p>
<p>I agree with that plan</p>
<p><strong>TheShades — Yesterday at 23:50</strong></p>
<p>Solid. Go For it!</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Yesterday at 23:50</strong></p>
<p>yes, that might do it</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Yesterday at 23:50</strong></p>
<p>So long as you have an impression now then that's what we need, the key can come later</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 23:51</strong></p>
<p>Grab extra potions?&nbsp; I suppose I could do that too.</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Yesterday at 23:51</strong></p>
<p>don't take too many</p>
<p>one or two disappearing in an incident is fine, but people might get extra suspicious if you take more</p>
<p><strong>Peach — Yesterday at 23:51</strong></p>
<p>Not if the inventory is off...</p>
<p>I'll go now</p>
<p><strong>n̖̱͕ob͙͝o҉̹dy̷͕ — Yesterday at 23:51</strong></p>
<p>alright</p>
<p>best of luck!</p>
<p><strong>ChuckMorris — Yesterday at 23:52</strong></p>
<p>Good luck, may your walls be salted and your floors damp.</p>
