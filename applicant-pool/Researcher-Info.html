  <li><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1N4pXTcc8YGMclsfu1c0VqKaLdMRcHAwOX9d-G_mnNsw/edit?usp=sharing"><u>https://docs.google.com/document/d/1N4pXTcc8YGMclsfu1c0VqKaLdMRcHAwOX9d-G_mnNsw/edit?usp=sharing</u></a> (If someone could parse this, that would be great) &lt; Elaborate? Do you want us to share this a Lil more?:D</li>
  <li>Working On a classified mission</li>
  <li>Was chosen for Necromancy after performing well in application</li>
  <li>Seems to enjoy cooking, art, board games, bugs, odd cursed creatures, many more, and also appears to have played Minecraft (<i>yes, the game)</i>
    <ul>
      <li>Enjoys learning of our plane in particular.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Doesn’t like the word krawlk, don’t use that. It’s a slur for their people.</li>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Gillie Mason</strong></h1>
<ul>
  <li>Alchemy Researcher</li>
  <li>Born to two Liath (analogous to Nordic people?) immigrants from the far north, a difficult place to survive.</li>
  <li>White hair, keeps it out of her face, shoulder-length, fair skinned, prefers to wear practical clothing.</li>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Elham Schreiber</strong></h1>
<ul>
  <li>Aetherial Field Researcher</li>
  <li>Speaks "subterran" (English)</li>
  <li>It seems to be Arabic based. They said "shay' min hadha alqabili" which seems to translate a bit like "something like this is my tribe"</li>
  <li>Doesn't care about professionalism or impressing bosses</li>
  <li>Seems to come and go a lot. Busy? Distracted? Described herself as "here a bit and not here a bit."</li>

  <li>But it's scary doing field research with Planar?!</li>
  <li>Likes to drink whisky to concentrate, apparently also takes [T/W].</li>
  <li>Seems to be partners with Gillie, but not wives yet</li>
  <li>Describes their magic as "chucking things and making fires" and "hell yeah"</li>
  <li>Not that pious, still seems respectful of gods however</li>
  <li>Used the word "krawlk" negatively like - "I'm no krawlk"</li>
  <li>Later said they were going to get Pauchik and said they were "back with the krawlk" so possible animosity between the two, or racism?</li>
  <li>Pauchik then took over it seems and Elham wasn't around anymore. Pauchik explained they were "going through loss" from a hard assignment before this one.</li>
  <li>Pauchik also said “Elham will return, we will have kindness on standby just in case she is having a bad day again!” So medicated?</li>
</ul>
<p><i><strong>Elham has described their appearance</strong></i></p>
<p>“I'm a human alright, but my people come from down south in the blightlands. I've got darker skin, kinda Carmel really. Black hair kept short for field work and part of my head is shaved. Brown orange eyes I think? Don't look at myself much. A few scars here and there. I like clothes that are functional, sturdy, and comfortable. I wanna be able to lounge or be able to run if things get messy in a lab or on the field.” - and also has said they are shorter than Gillie.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Gillie is their “registered partner.”</li>
  <li>Trained four years “the academy”, but spent 8 years in illegal training.</li>
  <li>Called Meer(Sot?) an idiot. [ this is a joke submission ish lmao ]</li>
</ul>
