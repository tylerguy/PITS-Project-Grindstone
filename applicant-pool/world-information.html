<h2>Department Explanations</h2>
<h3><u>Aetherial Studies</u></h3>
<p>Aetherial Studies is a research department dedicated to the study of movement of aether that exists as the matrix for which all planes exist within.&nbsp; They also study spellcraft and the theory behind it including its three component parts being aeonization, summation, and programming.&nbsp; Aeonization is the process by which an opening is created between the plane of interest, the one being cast on, and the aetherial matrix that usually requires an aeonized object or spell book with four point casting.&nbsp; Summation is the manipulation of wave patterns within the Aetherial matrix to move aether to the opening in the plane from aeonization and helps regulate the rate of flow of aether. &nbsp; Programming is not to be confused with the programming school and is the process of converting aether into something else, this is where you determine what the spell being cast is.&nbsp; Some spells require more aether while others a greater rate of flow for aether.&nbsp; One should only summate what they are prepared to program.&nbsp; The schools of magic are also defined by our experts within this department.</p>
<h3><u>Alchemy</u></h3>
<p>Within this department alchemical research is conducted.&nbsp; Belthidian law is considered through Toristic processes of observation not too dissimilar to the scientific method.&nbsp; Concepts of the physical and metaphysical are described, applied, and further evaluated through the utilization of elementary alchemical components and use of equipment.&nbsp; This research is important not only for the creation of new products in several industries but allows for closer examination of the Belthidian laws on the material within the world.&nbsp; Proper tools, resources, and planar positional&nbsp; are all considered when examining these laws closely.</p>
<p><strong>Chat from GillieManson, Alchemy researcher</strong></p>
<p>Unfortunately the examination of the elementary is not always practical that is why we have a wheel for general consideration and practical alchemy.&nbsp; The wheel is imperfect and there are more than a dozen proposed models for different situations utilized for alchemical experimentation. The wheel can be best described as eight segments.&nbsp; These eight segments have opposing properties across from themselves and volatility is assumed by measuring the distance and quality of opposing properties.&nbsp; This however does not verify adhesion which is described in another model.&nbsp; Still so simple geometrics is the name of another "elementary" model but has not gained much traction here.</p>
<p>The Belthidian laws are to be investigated and discovered.&nbsp; Some have been defined however.&nbsp; some laws can be observed in the Belthidian holy text.</p>
<h3><u>Cultural Studies</u></h3>
<p>Cultural Studies, often simply called Culture, is currently one of the largest departments within UMAD due to the number of subjects examined here.&nbsp; The study of history, communications, religion, economics, politics, and many others are found within this department.&nbsp; While there has been consideration of separating this department in the future all these studies remain within a single department as it is the goal of the department to understand the interactions, motivations, and behavior of people.&nbsp; Both social research and experimentation is conducted here.</p>
<h3><u>Engineering&nbsp;</u></h3>
<p>The Engineering Department is the most frequently utilized for military research and development but it also is responsible for several civil projects especially during reconstruction.&nbsp; The engineering department studies the Belthidian Laws, their effects on material , and the utilization of these ideas to design and improve machines of function or processes.&nbsp; Please note this department presently lacks a Department Head.</p>
<h3><u>Necromancy</u></h3>
<p>The Necromancy Department contrary to the understanding most have is not limited to the animation of dead tissue.&nbsp; While service undead are produced by employees here the research team is dedicated to the advanced study of Aetherial programming.&nbsp; They understand in collaboration with other departments how to create immaterial and Aetherial systems that interact with material.&nbsp; Constructs of glass, metal, wood, or any real material are programmed by designing complicated multidimensional programs to cover an area called an Aetherial frame.&nbsp; Aside from constructs and animation the necromancy department is responsible for stationary constructs often referred to as enchanted objects.&nbsp; The Necromancy department assists in security, locating and correcting issues within programming, and the theory of programming the aforementioned constructs.</p>
<h3><u>Planar Studies</u></h3>
<p>Planar Studies, typically referred to as Planar, examines extraplanar interplay.&nbsp; This department observes the Belthidian Laws and how their interactions with material differ within five-dimensional loci and the interaction between other planes in relative space.&nbsp; This is typically conducted through the mass summation of aether to produce planar overlay and observing the change in natural phenomena.&nbsp; This description requires adequate warning as determined by The Cultural Research Department as the study of extra-planar space comes with several risks.&nbsp; While the laws on some planes may change the interactions with material causing one to quickly re-evaluate the definition of “air” others could cause the loss of the concept of time or alter personal perception to be incompatible with their native plane.&nbsp; Many Planar Studies Researchers act as field researchers and conduct inter-departmental studies to further our understanding of the universe beyond their own plane.&nbsp; The examination of how space in the universe affects the reality we live in has nearly limitless applications.</p>
<p><strong>Notes on Planar Studies</strong></p>
<p>The universe exists in 5 dimensional space and so requires two models to visualize it.&nbsp; The biconical model and the fluid disk model. The fluid disk is a fluid mosaic of amorphous ever changing shapes that have a general region defined proximally to the center of all things or from the point of the reality that people are familiar with.&nbsp; Think of it like a flat disk-like surface with small areas that are constantly in flux as to where their walls are. The space between them is not empty, it’s called aether which moves fluidly and can be disrupted. The space the aether doesn’t occupy is filled by the limits of these planes of existence. When a clear opening exists between two realities they can overlap at points.</p>
<p>This is called a planar overlay and strange things can happen at these points. The wave patterns of the aether can be disrupted through a process called summation which is the second step involved in aetherial magic casting of three. Summation is essentially the summation of wave patterns through small manipulations that accumulate.&nbsp; In addition to this design is the idea of rings.&nbsp; Rings are concentric circles radiating out from the center of reality; however by tradition the first ring is defined as where the plane that the living are familiar with is located, the center of all things is the eighth ring, and the side of the rings opposite the living reality continues to ascend. So while planes may be the same distance from the center as the living reality (this term has been retired) one is the 15th ring and the other is the 1st ring.&nbsp; Space may be interacted with in a 5 dimensional manner however meaning there are additional dimensions within these “flat surfaces” expressed in the fluid disk model. The biconical model was therefore developed to express this and time dilations in space.&nbsp; In the biconical model the universe looks like an hourglass where the central point is the center of reality much like the center of the disk was too but it also shifts with overlays to explain the passage of time. Time moves in one direction, there is no going back in time even for gods.&nbsp; The rate of passage is determined by proximity to the center however meaning the perception of time slows as you get closer to the center. 100 years might pass in one place in reality before 1 year elsewhere.</p>
<p>Addendum: These models are still used today but ideas within these notes are contested.</p>
<p>A diagram to accompany that uses the biconical model. We live on the surface of the hourglass by the way, not the region inside. Important distinction. - Drawn by ThisisAName0 based on the notes on planar studies provided by UMAD</p>

<h2>Schools of Magic</h2>
<h3>Aeonization</h3>
<p>Aeonization as a school of magic that is utilized to undo links within programming and safely disperse aether.&nbsp; Aeonization specialists can quickly remove programming and inhibit the use of spells while also creating new aeonized objects for use in spellcasting.&nbsp; This school is also effective and maintaining Aetherial residue in select space to disguise auras, make auras visible, or create Aetherial impressions that can later be made visible by aeonization specialists.</p>
<h3>Dismissal</h3>
<p>Dismissal is the school of magic that specializes in the movement of material to its naturalized plane over a distance.&nbsp; This effect does not require specificity but is more effective the closer the subject is to the naturalized plane.&nbsp; This school can also work in the inverse locking an entity or object to a non naturalized plane.</p>
<h3>Healing</h3>
<p>Healing is a poorly understood school of magic with limited current applications but a plethora of applications in theory.&nbsp; Healing utilizes biological systems' own machinery and resources to rapidly move, act, or stimulate for a desired result.&nbsp; This could mean the rapid clotting of blood, the induction of particular emotions, the removal of sensation, the creation of new sensation, and many other applications.</p>
<h3>Illusion</h3>
<p>Illusion is the manipulation of transverse and longitudinal waves of material to create visual or auditory sensations and do not directly affect biological systems.&nbsp; This manipulation of light and sound is not limited to visible or auditory spectrums of different species.</p>
<h3>Programming</h3>
<p>Programming is the creation of Aetherial frames to overlap material for manipulation of the material or creation of a constant summation and programming at a designated location.&nbsp; This means enchantment, constructs, and undead</p>
<h3>Summoning</h3>
<p>Summoning is the displacement of material from one plane to another by means of netting.&nbsp; Further specification of the material or naturalized plane yields greater complexity to casting and often requires greater rate and quantity of aether.&nbsp; Summoning from more distant planes also requires a greater expense of aether.</p>
<h3>Synthesis</h3>
<p>Synthesis is the youngest study and relies heavily on advanced understanding of Belthidian Laws.&nbsp; Most casters follow general rules for casting synthesis but absolutes have been determined through experimentation.&nbsp; This is the manipulation of material to take on a different function. Synthesis makes one material from another.&nbsp; Crystalline structures have been theorized as possible but experimentally have rarely been synthesized.</p>
<h3>Thermokinetics</h3>
<p>Thermokinetics is the father school of synthesis.&nbsp; This school has often been utilized in warfare but also in civil projects.&nbsp; It is the manipulation of material, the readiness to transfer thermal energy, and the movement of thermal energy.&nbsp; Heat may be displaced allowing for a place of cold near the hot spot or material moved rapidly to create a vacuum.&nbsp; The creation of a vacuum is much easier however in translocation.</p>
<h3>Translocation</h3>
<p>Translocation is the displacement but not movement of material from one point in space to another within the same plane.&nbsp; While summoning could function this way in theory it is much more practical to translocation objects on the same plane.&nbsp; With that said translocation is often determined impractical due to the difficulty of specializing in it.&nbsp; Long distances of displacement and large objects being displaced increase error and risk.&nbsp; Translocation into other material could end in serious consequences.&nbsp; For this reason transportation and delivery of objects through translocation is not done.&nbsp; Instead translocation often has practical applications in wartime, defense, and manufacturing.</p>
