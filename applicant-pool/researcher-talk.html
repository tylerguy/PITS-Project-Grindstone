<p>Pauchik:<br><br>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br>“Department has me on working a few things out for your mission but that information isn't accessible to you!”<br>“I don't handle that [how departments are assigned] unfortunately.”<br>“I chose it [Necromancy]! I performed excellent in my application process.”<br>“I'm not aware of their schedule unfortunately.” [responding to “do you know if researchers from other departments will arrive anytime soon?”]<br><br><br><br>“I'm sorry Dr. Butterfly I'm not certain what you are meaning” [talking about halloween]<br>“Hmm... maybe if I knew the half season October fell in?”<br>“Of course seasons occur! Some people define our calendar by half season, other's don't know how to tell time.”<br>“What a fun way to celebrate! [about halloween again] On the first of Autumn there is a lot of celebration and commemoration. More importantly we reach out to friends and family we haven't spoke to in some time. Of course every nation and in fact every town seems to have their own ways of celebrating. Strongbox* goes into hiding, although that happens often.” [* “Just a town, we have several.”]<br><br><br><br>“I tend to not eat bird often…<br>At least nothing that looks too familiar”&nbsp;<br>“Smaller game maybe”<br>Say that they eat “All sorts of things.”<br>Favourite food is “Dried cherries soaked in wine and served with lord sauce.”<br>“It's [lord sauce] a sweet sauce made from spices and red wine typically but there are several ways to make it”<br>“I can get you a recipe!”<br>“Hmm... I found a recipe using familiar measurements to you but I think it'll turn out a bit...not sweet... I add molasses or brown sugar to mine!&nbsp;</p>
<p>1 tsp. ground cloves, 5 tsp. ground cinnamon, 1 tsp. ground nutmeg, 1 tsp. ground ginger, 1 tsp. ground cardamon, ¼ cup toasted bread crumbs, 1 tsp. ground black pepper, ½ cup red wine vinegar.<br>Combine all ingredients and let set for about 30 minutes. Add additional water until desired consistency is reached.”</p>
<p><br><br><br>“It gets pretty cool here in Dial during the winter.”<br>“One ought to keep warm seasonally.” [In response to: “Random question: In Dial, are cloaks worn in the cold season; are they “in style”, as one might say?”]<br>“Not [cold] all the time. Summers can get pretty warm.”&nbsp;<br><br><br><br><strong>“</strong>Might be true of some species.” [In response to “Easiest way to someone's heart is through the stomach, as the idiom implies.”]<br>“I'm a Val! You?” [Responding to “actually, I've been meaning to ask, what species are you?”]<br>“Well, there are a lot of different ones but we can't interbreed with one another. I myself am covered in feathers and have long hands that protrude out of my feather stocked arms. No flight unfortunately but at close examination of our anatomy it's suggested that our ancestors might have been able to. Culture believes we see in a very different way to Humans. Five instead of three primary colors. Maybe that's why everything is beautiful to me! Sad for you though. Not to mean offense.”<br>“That I am [bipedal]!”<br>“A bit different but it has it's similarities [a kenku to a val].”<br>“Travel is complicated but there are a few of us who manage. Constructs...more complicated”<br><br><br><br>“Hmm... I wish I could show you a picture [of what their race looks like] but unfortunately I can't really send visual media from where I am to you yet.”<br>“Certainly! I found them [pictures of their hobby] on your internet.”<br>“Text is much easier.”</p>
<p>“And you don't allow the other races to use your technology?!”<br>“And the one's that can [utilise our technology]?”<br>“Such litter diversity...&nbsp; At least you have fun spiders.”<br>“You just need to know how to properly milk them [spiders]!”<br><br>“If you believe Helshians we are related!” [presumably Vals to birds(?)]<br>They [Helshians] are Kadminites who separated from their church under Helshia and adopt some ideologies that are often problematic for my kind..and the rau.... and many others”<br>“Worshippers of Kadmin [Kadminites]. The big burning ball in the sky.”<br>“I wouldn't really generalize about an entire species but I suppose the Rau and Val are more probable to have solidarity in places we are often discriminated against. Like any species some like us and some don't.”<br>“I suppose several [reasons as to why Vals are discriminated against]. Even I find myself annoying sometimes! That might be deep seated self loathing though that I suppress with humor and constant distractions of work and my art.”<br><br>“Well of course [there are smaller topics inside necromancy]! Some people specialize in communications technology and others are different areas of theory craft and practical programming. There is a LOT to the study.”<br>“I enjoy programming simple structures a lot.”<br><br>“Certainly, I work with a few [liches]. Just an intelligent undead with an aptitude for the aetherial. Might be one myself eventually.”<br>“It [becoming a lich] starts with being dead!<br>“Sentience certainly. If you want to get particular about consciousness that's a culture question.” [Responding to “so liches exist in your world! are they functionally immortal? as undead, do they mantain their consciousness from when they were alive?’]<br>“Someone like me needs to animate you [to turn you into a lich].”<br>“I suppose if you had a aetherial strucutred programmed in a way to program you it would work but that sounds pretty well outside the realm of possibility.” [Responding to “Once you're dead do you have to be reanimated by someone else to become a lich?”]<br>“Well in this case their personality may or may not be in tact [after reanimation]. Freshly dead a good enough necromancer can get them MOSTLY back but assumptions need made. Here we have people called Wake Necromancers who animate the dead after reviewing stories about their life from their loved ones in order for the deceased to say goodbye to the living. It's for the living's benefit, not the dead.”<br>“Of course there are many perpetuities.” [question being: “So do you not believe in an afterlife?”]<br>“A soul is not consciousness I think? Again, a culture question.”<br><br>“That's all handled with your necromancy license. there are legal limitations. Also possession is not the same as animation. You can certainly own many constructs but there are only so many undead one might own. Also they all need registered through UMAD”<br>“I like to think it's limitless [what you can make constructs out of]!! Then I fail over and over again. Lead is basically unusable.”<br>“From what I've experience the aether doesn't do well with lead. It soaks it up like a sponge. Can't work with it”<br>“Not as far as I know. It doesn't really seem to let go.” [In response to “Does that mean that Lead could be used for Aether storage?”]<br><br>“Ooop. My time is almost up!”<br>“Janet [determines when they can communicate with us]”<br><br>“[They’re] Good enough [at necromancy] to be a researcher?”<br>“We are always learning. I often have symposium and I often learn from my co-workers.”<br><br>“It's just a saying I'm told. [“not trusting extinct things”]”<br><br>“Having to do with the god of over consumption or something.” [Question being “ooh whats Bracobian”]<br>Blue sky red sun. Alchemy claims that color pattern suggests a difference in the composition of the sky in relation to your world but really...how do they test the sky?”<br>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>GillieMason:</h1>
<p><br>"Gillie Mason, Research Assistant, Alchemy, Third Block.”<br>“I'm here to answer questions.&nbsp;<br>Be your guide to Alchemy and convince you to work hard to be here and not in other departments.”<br>“I don't work for them [other departments] . I work for alchemy.”<br>“But we all work for UMAD”<br>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Unfortunately the examination of the elementary is not always practical that is why we have a wheel for general consideration and practical alchemy. The wheel is imperfect and there are more than a dozen proposed models for different situations utilized for alchemical experimentation.”<br>“Not at this time [are they able to send an image of the wheel]. Pauchik has a job to do to help me do my own job.”<br>“The wheel can be best described as eight segments. These eight segments have opposing properties across from themselves and volatility is assumed by measuring the distance and quality of opposing properties. This however does not verify adhesion which is described in another model. Still so simple geometrics is the name of another "elementary" model but has not gained much traction here.”<br><br>“Study of causality is its [metaphysical concepts] simplest explanation but that in of itself is a loaded statement.”<br>“Empirical research by Toristic process with experimentation [is how they analyze casualty]. We have theory and equipment as tools for investigation.”<br><br>“This assumes the spiritual component is not practical. Alchemy, like other departments, studies the Belthidian Laws and we must research in accordance with what we understand to be true until we have proven it false.”<br>“The Belthidian laws are to be investigated and discovered. Some have been defined however. some laws can be observed in the Belthidian holy text.”<br>“The Toristic process is a system of evaluation not something tied to Belthidian Laws”</p>
<p>“This [the toristic process is akin to the scientific method] is how Culture has come to describe it to me in your words, yes”<br><br>“I'm a girl”<br>“Gillie isn't an obvious name I suppose”<br>“I'm human but both my parents are Liath immigrants”<br>“Human's from the north. We tend to have white hair. It's best for hiding.”<br>“Everything bigger than you with sharp teeth.”<br>“We are prey in that environment.”<br>“When I was born I was given a name, my parents' not so much”<br>“You are assigned a name when you are able to survive on your own up North.”<br>“To have children and for them to survive is your one goal. Then your purpose is met. You are of the dead and are recognized as such.”<br>“They [their parents] walked”<br>“A lot”<br><br>“I happen to be a botanist but I'm not from the North.”<br>“My parents are”<br>“Oh? What kind of Botany do you study? Structural?”<br>“Need to Know...but I will say I think we will be friends if you are in alchemy.”<br>“I'm more the inverse [of researching the practical uses of plants and fungi].”<br><br>“Nothing like that [an electron microscope] no... Now I want one however”<br>“UMAD is one of the few institutions that has ground lenses for observation but I suppose not as strong as yours. We do observe larger more visible characteristics however.”<br>“That [magnifying glass] looks exciting. I want one of those too”<br>“But yes, it [magnifying glass] seems to have at least a ground lens”<br>“What am I even looking at… [when shown a picture of a microscope]”<br>“I think I should get this [microscope] over to engineering…”<br>“It seems like a masterful use of ground lenses”<br>“I'm certain UMAD will do...something with this [electron microscope].”<br><br>“I need some Orzo but I still have a few ticks.”<br>“[Orzo is] Barley drink, good to wakeup with”<br>“I have an Orzo lab in my room on block 3. I also have a little bit of coffee I've been saving for a special occasion.”<br>“No, no alcohol [in Orzo]”<br>“Ever since I was introduced to water elementals I avoid alcohol when I can.”<br>“Most people drink beer here. That's how they hydrate. I prefer water when I can though. Wells aren't always clean however.”<br>“distillation is done but not really everywhere”<br>“People can be lazy and stupid sometimes.”<br><br>“My opinion [on cheese] is I've cultured a lot of it on my farm before I moved to the city and you should be careful using a name like The Cheese God else someone might take offense.”<br>“People who worship a god who has luxury goods or cheese as their domain… [might take offense]”<br>“In that case you [The Cheese God] cannot be a god for a god cannot be any more or less than it is and does not share its domain with others in perfection and beauty”<br>“The someone who is offended is me if that wasn't clear”<br><br>“Other people are messaging me.”<br>“Outside of this chat.”<br>“Culture suggests I not share private chats.”<br>“So ask eachother what is said there. I'll answer what I can one at a time”<br><br>“Dogs are kept as pets here too. I'd need a closer look at the flowers though”<br>“I can't keep them [their dog] on campus but yes”<br>“They're [bluebells] beautiful. I'm imagining their smell.”</p>
<p><br>“What you are describing is healing magic not alchemy. There are theories however to preserve food without the use of salt that are under examination within my department. In fact I'm the assistant in such a research project concerning meat”<br><br>“We work with them [Culture] but no more than any other department I suppose.”<br>“Especially when the experiment requires altered states of consciousness.”</p>
<p>“From what culture tells me, your chemistry and our alchemy have fundamental differences but the goals of the study are very similar.”<br><br>“Ah hell! I'm late”<br>“I need to go. Right now”<br>“Bye, I might be back. whatever the boss says.”</p>
<h1>ElhamSchreiber:</h1>
<p>“Still figuring out the little face thing [pfp?] for my chat”</p>
<p>“I'm Field Researcher Schreiber. I'll be assigned to this task.”<br>“I'm pretty bad at this face thing.”<br>“Don't have a pet but my partner does.”<br>“Do I do it correctly?”<br>“I'm assuming I did the face thing correctly”<br><br>“Just got back from field work with Planar so it depends on what you mean "day" I suppose”<br>“I'm already a field researcher so there isn't much point in me impressing the bosses so I hope you don't mind me saying screw professionalism”<br>“A field researcher specifically. One that's here a bit and not here a bit.”<br>“Field Researchers are just researchers who get to do the exciting stuff. Although excitement comes with consequences often. We need to be the best of the best. Healthy and intelligent. It's a damn shame that goes to waste sometimes. Especially in Planar.”<br>“Always exciting to work with them”<br>“Nothing [is wrong with Planar], I'm proud to work with those guys”<br>“Just a terrifying job doing field research with them”<br>“Well yeah, they switch their department head constantly”<br><br>“Sending constructs is difficult when it comes to planes. A lot can interfere with their programming especially when it comes to moving them to other planes.”<br>“Imagine for a moment that fluid doesn't adhere to objects like they should in a plane. Now imagine your body in said plane.”<br>“Things sorta just spill out”<br>“Anything could act differently [depending an the plane you are on]. That's kinda what they study”<br>“If we didn't have much of an explanation then experimentation wouldn't be all too productive on the regular. Although there is still much to be discovered.”<br>“If you like lots of simple math and logic Necromancy is a good place to be. Planar and Aetherial Studies though... You gotta be good at your analytics.”<br>“or not”</p>
<p>“It just really depends on wht you're doing”</p>
<p>“Comment ca va?”<br>“bien”<br>“Parle Victorand”<br>“It's [victorand] the language of a country out West but we get a few foreign nationals in Dial”<br>“My first language is Almawtiun but most people call it something else out here. But Subterran does just fine”<br>“Subterran [is what the language they’re speaking rn is called]”<br>“shay' min hadha alqabili [Almawtiun, arabic in our world].”<br>“Although I haven't used it in years”<br>“like... a decade”<br><br>“360 intervals [is the length of their years]”<br>“That's [interval being the time it takes for kadmin to rise ,set, and then rise] the one”<br>“moments beget breaths beget ticks beget parts (partitions) beget intervals beget weeks beget months beget seasons beget years....”<br>“But I'm fine to speak in your units of time if you need”<br>“Four [seasons]”<br>“Months are half seasons”<br><br>“So I'm not real good at these tools. That's for the shut ins at Necromancy. How do I look up who is here? I want to know who else is talking to you about departments and crap.”</p>
<p>“Gillie [is here]?!”</p>
<p>“Ah Damn, that deserves another drink”</p>
<p>“Nothin at all [is wrong with Gillie being here]. Just didn't think HR would allow that.”</p>
<p>“Registered partner”<br>“Like a we go home together”<br>“Whoah, haven't gone that far yet [as far as marriage]”</p>
<p>“Yeah... probably should change the conversation”<br>“It's alright. Real happy she is here but that was my mistake making it personal”</p>
<p>“You guys don't need to know that”<br><br>“What about programming?”<br>“It's a study of magic that uses aetherial frames with differing frequencies, intensities, and spatial relations to command something to do something.”</p>
<p>“It's like your programming but a lot more complicated”</p>
<p>“I'm really a thermo specialist”<br>“chucking things and making fires”<br>“That's [thermokinetics] the one”<br>“Not an Anahidian”</p>
<p>“Can't confirm it”<br>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Some people simplify it [thermokinetics] to throw rock and make fire. Which to be fair is pretty cool but we also do other things.”<br>“and move the particles into one another with quick transference. This sudden stop has some pretty nifty effects.”<br>“When you stop one thing something somewhere else has to go, go, go”<br>“Or I suppose the inverse is really whats true”</p>
<p>“If I say sure will it make me look like I know what you're saying [talking about newtons law]?”<br>“I'm sure I'll learn about it from Culture or Necromancy.”<br><br>“I know something that sounds similar [to newton’s law]”<br>“A God's Power may be created but never destroyed. That which is inferior may not supersede that which is superior...blah blah blah”<br>“The Belthidian Laws are all spiritual in their writing, at least the ones in religious text, but there is some reasonable and secular understanding that can be applied to them”<br>“Dictated? More like hands off”<br>“god of creation, natural laws, etc”</p>
<p>“magic”</p>
<p>“logic”</p>
<p>“All that”<br><br>“Imagine for a moment you've got two little balls bouncing about right?”<br>“One ball in motion and the other stationary”<br>“Then that ball hits the other in a vacuum”<br>“And they are both perfectly elastic”</p>
<p>“Both balls are also of exact size, shape, and material”<br>“Well ball A collides and begins moving at half speed.”<br>“Ball Sad runs off at the same rate”<br>“Don't hit people unless you have to for like safety.”<br>“Not always elastic”<br>“Sure! Synth and thermo people often study the little bitty things and how they do when they collide. Right on or brushing against”<br>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Kinetic energy is conserved but the plane you are in is it's own unique system”<br>“So every spell cast adds to the system but other spells could vent the system too”<br><br>“You know what? Give me some words. A whole lot of them. I'll have necromancy do their thing with this device. We have lots of words here that probably make no sense to you all. The inverse is true too. If I can find that example to make communication easier then I think that'll be the best way to do this.”<br>“And maybe drink a little less my second come around”<br>“That [like Newton’s laws]”<br>“probably [deal a lot with quantum mechanics]”<br><br>“Only a few in script the rest are things we determine through experimentation. We didn't exactly get a guidebook to the universe.”<br>“Here in Belthas?”</p>
<p>“A real mess”<br>“That's an excellent question and when I began my training I knew like 6 of them [Belthidian Laws].”</p>
<p>“I would never say that [Belthid is the main deity]”<br>Biggest faith in the region sure. They are kinda a big deal</p>
<p>“Translo guys just play with the material real hard. Pop it one place and pop it somewhere else. Forced overlays in very close five dimensional space.”</p>
<p><br>“I'm probably missing questions”</p>
<p>“Hey, just need a breath to go grab some whisky. It'll help the concentration.”</p>
<p>“It's just rock gut”</p>
<p>“Burns just looking at it”<br><br>“Well I trained for 4 years in academy and spent 8 years in illegal training”<br><br>“They are saying I'm no sales person”<br>“To each their own.”<br><br>“Because the big guys told necromancy and planar to figure it out”<br><br>“I'm no krawlk [other word for Val?].”</p>
