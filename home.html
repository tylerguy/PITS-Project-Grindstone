<p>The Peach Investigation and Tactics Squad (also known as PITS or The PITS) was formed to investigate the society we know as UMAD. Our primary mission is to observe and investigate their activities, as well as working towards completing the objectives we've been given on Project Grindstone, aiming to gain a place within UMAD.</p>
